# Ops Tax Basics - Checklist

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1Understand Your Tax Situation

**Tax types for solopreneurs:**

| Tax | What It Is | Rate |
|-----|------------|------|
| **Income tax** | Federal tax on profit | 10-37% (brackets) |
| **Self-employment tax** | Social Security + Medicare | 15.3% |
| **State income tax** | State tax on income | 0-13% (varies) |
| **Sales tax** | Tax on sales (if applicable) | Varies by state |

**Self-employment tax breakdown:**
```
Self-employment tax = 15.3%
- Social Security: 12.4% (on first ~$160K)
- Medicare: 2.9% (no limit)
- Additional Medicare: 0.9% (over $200K)
```

**Effective tax rate example:**
```
Net profit: $100,000

Self-employment tax: $14,130 (15.3% x 92.35%)
Federal income tax: ~$15,000 (after deductions)
State tax: ~$5,000 (5% state)

Total: ~$34,000 (34% effective rate)
```

### Step 2Choose Tax-Efficient Structure

**Entity tax treatment:**

| Entity | How Taxed | SE Tax? | Best For |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Sole Prop** | Personal return | Yes | Simple, low income |
| **LLC (default)** | Personal return | Yes | Most solopreneurs |
| **LLC (S-Corp)** | Salary + distributions | Partially | $80K+ profit |
| **S-Corp** | Salary + distributions | Partially | $80K+ profit |

**S-Corp election benefit:**
```
Without S-Corp (LLC default):
$100K profit → $15.3K SE tax

With S-Corp election:
$50K salary → $7.65K SE tax
$50K distribution → $0 SE tax
Savings: ~$7,650/year

(Must pay reasonable salary)
```

**When to consider S-Corp:**
- Consistent profit over $80K
- Willing to do payroll
- Can justify reasonable salary
- Worth the added complexity

### Step 3Track Deductible Expenses

**Common deductions:**

| Category | Examples | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Home office** | Rent, utilities, internet | Dedicated space required |
| **Equipment** | Computer, monitors, phone | Can depreciate or Section 179 |
| **Software** | Tools, subscriptions | Business use only |
| **Marketing** | Ads, content, design | Keep receipts |
| **Professional services** | Legal, accounting | Business related |
| **Education** | Courses, books | Related to business |
| **Travel** | Business trips | Must be business purpose |
| **Health insurance** | Premiums | Self-employed deduction |
| **Retirement** | SEP-IRA, Solo 401k | Reduces taxable income |

**Home office deduction:**

**Simplified method:**
```
$5 per square foot, up to 300 sq ft
Max: $1,500 deduction
```

**Actual expense method:**
```
Home office: 200 sq ft
Total home: 2,000 sq ft
Business use: 10%

Rent: $2,000/mo x 10% = $200
Utilities: $200/mo x 10% = $20
Internet: $100/mo x 100% = $100 (if business essential)

Monthly deduction: $320
Annual: $3,840
```

### Step 4Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts

**Retirement options:**

| Account | Contribution Limit | Best For |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **SEP-IRA** | 25% of net, up to ~$66K | Simple, high income |
| **Solo 401k** | $22.5K + 25% of net | Catch-up, Roth option |
| **Traditional IRA** | $6.5K | Additional savings |
| **Roth IRA** | $6.5K | Tax-free growth |

**SEP-IRA example:**
```
Net self-employment income: $100,000
Maximum contribution: ~$18,500 (special calculation)
Tax savings at 24% bracket: $4,440
```

**Health savings account (HSA):**
```
High-deductible health plan required
2024 limit: $4,150 (individual), $8,300 (family)
Triple tax benefit: deduction + growth + withdrawal
```
