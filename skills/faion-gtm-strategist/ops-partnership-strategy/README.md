## Problem

You're trying to grow alone. Your reach is limited to your own audience and marketing budget. Meanwhile, others have access to your ideal customers. Partnerships let you leverage other people's audiences, credibility, and resources.

Partnership strategy means creating mutually beneficial relationships that accelerate growth for both parties.

---

## Framework

Partnerships follow this process:

```
IDENTIFY  -> Find potential partners
EVALUATE  -> Assess fit and value
PROPOSE   -> Make a compelling offer
EXECUTE   -> Deliver on commitments
GROW      -> Expand successful partnerships
```

### Step 1: Identify Partnership Types

**Partnership categories:**

| Type | What They Offer | What You Offer |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Affiliate** | Promotion to their audience | Commission per sale |
| **Co-marketing** | Shared audience access | Content/audience |
| **Integration** | Technical connection | Technical connection |
| **Reseller** | Sales and support | Product + margin |
| **White-label** | Distribution | Unbranded product |
| **Strategic** | Resources, credibility | Resources, expertise |

**Best partner types for solopreneurs:**

| Stage | Priority Partnership |
|-------|---------------------|
| Pre-launch | Advisors, beta testers |
| Launch | Affiliates, co-marketing |
| Growth | Integrations, content partners |
| Scale | Resellers, strategic |

### Step 2: Find Potential Partners

**Partner discovery:**

| Source | How to Find | Signals |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Complementary products | Similar audience, different solution | Your customers use them |
| Influencers | Content creators in your space | Engaged audience |
| Communities | Forums, Slack groups, Discord | Active membership |
| Content creators | Bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers | Quality content |
| Adjacent businesses | Same customer, different need | Non-competing |

**Partner fit criteria:**

| Criterion | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| Audience overlap | They reach your customers |
| Reputation | Their quality reflects on you |
| Responsiveness | They follow through |
| Mutual benefit | Win-win ensures longevity |

### Step 3: Evaluate Partnership Value

**Value assessment:**

| Factor | Questions |
|--------|-----------|
| Reach | How many people can they reach? |
| Relevance | How relevant is their audience? |
| Trust | How much does their audience trust them? |
| Effort | How much work is required? |
| Risk | What could go wrong? |

**Partnership scorecard:**

```
Partner: [Name]

Reach: [1-5]
Relevance: [1-5]
Trust: [1-5]
Effort required: [1-5] (lower is better)
Risk: [1-5] (lower is better)

Total: [X]/25
Proceed: Yes/No
```

### Step 4: Structure the Partnership

**Affiliate partnerships:**

| Model | Commission | Best For |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Per sale | 20-40% | Digital products |
| Per lead | $5-50 | SaaS, services |
| Recurring | 10-20% monthly | Subscriptions |

| Bundle | Your product | Their product |
| Content | Article/guide | Distribution |
| Launch | Product | Testimonial, promotion |

### Step 5: Make the Outreach

**Outreach framework:**

```
1. Establish credibility (who you are)
2. Demonstrate understanding (their situation)
3. Propose value (what's in it for them)
4. Clear ask (specific next step)
```

**Email structure:**
