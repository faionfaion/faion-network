## Problem

You understand tax basics, but compliance is overwhelming. When are quarterly estimates due? What happens if you miss a payment? How do you avoid penalties? What records do you need to keep?

Tax compliance means meeting deadlines, avoiding penalties, and keeping proper records.

---

## Framework

Tax compliance follows this approach:

```
ESTIMATE    -> Calculate quarterly payments
PAY         -> Meet deadlines
TRACK       -> Keep records
FILE        -> Submit returns on time
PLAN        -> Prepare for next year
```

### Step 1: Pay Quarterly Estimates

**Who must pay:**
- Expected to owe $1,000+ in taxes
- Applies to most profitable solopreneurs

**Due dates:**
| Quarter | Period | Due Date |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Q1 | Jan-Mar | April 15 |
| Q2 | Apr-May | June 15 |
| Q3 | Jun-Aug | September 15 |
| Q4 | Sep-Dec | January 15 |

**Calculation methods:**

**Safe harbor (avoid penalties):**
```
Pay 100% of last year's tax liability
(110% if income > $150K)
```

**Current year method:**
```
Estimate current year profit
Calculate tax
Pay 25% per quarter
```

**Simple approach:**
```
Set aside 25-30% of profit
Transfer to savings quarterly
Pay estimates from savings
```

## Penalty Avoidance

**Common penalties:**

|---------|---------|------|--------------|
| **Underpayment** | Owe $1K+ at filing | Variable | Quarterly estimates |

| **Accuracy** | Errors on return | 20% | Double-check or hire CPA |

**Safe harbor strategy:**
```
Pay 100% of prior year tax
(110% if high earner)
→ No underpayment penalty
```

## State Tax Compliance

**State considerations:**

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
