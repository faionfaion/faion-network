### Step 1Identify What to Delegate

**Delegation matrix:**

|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Core competency | No | Your competitive advantage |
| Specialized skills | Yes | Others do it better |
| Time-consuming | Yes | Free your time |
| Repetitive | Yes | Automate or delegate |
| High-leverage | Maybe | Train someone trustworthy |

**Common contractor roles for solopreneurs:**

| Role | Tasks | Typical Rate |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Virtual assistant | Admin, scheduling, research | $10-30/hr |
| Designer | Graphics, UI, branding | $30-100/hr |
| Developer | Code, integrations | $50-150/hr |

| Video editor | Video production | $25-75/hr |

| Marketing | Ads, SEO, social | $40-150/hr |

**ROI calculation:**
```
Your hourly rate: $100/hr (based on income goals)
Task takes you: 5 hours/week = $500 value
Contractor rate: $30/hr x 5 = $150/week

Savings: $350/week = $18,200/year
Plus: You focus on higher-value work
```
