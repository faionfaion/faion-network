## Best Practices

### Communication

**Do:**
- Use async communication (Slack, Loom)
- Set clear response time expectations
- Document decisions
- Give context for tasks
- Provide examples

**Don't:**
- Micromanage
- Expect instant responses
- Assume they know context
- Skip feedback
- Change requirements constantly

### Task Assignment

**Good task:**
```
Task: Redesign pricing page
Goal: Increase conversions by 20%
Context: Current page has 2% conversion, competitors average 4%
Deliverable: Figma design + rationale
Deadline: Friday, Jan 26
Reference: [Link to competitor examples]
```

**Bad task:**
```
Make the pricing page better.
```

### Giving Feedback

**Positive feedback (amplify good work):**
```
Situation: Yesterday's blog post
Behavior: You added data visualization and internal links
Impact: Increased time-on-page by 40% and shares by 3x
Request: Keep using this approach for future posts
```

**Constructive feedback (improve quality):**
```
Situation: Last week's email campaign
Behavior: Subject line was generic ("Newsletter #5")
Impact: Open rate dropped to 12% (usually 25%)
Request: Use specific, benefit-focused subject lines (see examples)
```
