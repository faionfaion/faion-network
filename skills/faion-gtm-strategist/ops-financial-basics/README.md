## Problem

You're building a business, not a hobby. But you don't know your numbers. You don't know your profit margin, your runway, or whether you can afford to invest in growth. Without financial clarity, you're flying blind.

Financial tracking means understanding your money so you can make better decisions.

---

## Framework

Financial tracking follows this structure:

```
TRACK    -> Know where money goes
ANALYZE  -> Understand unit economics
MONITOR  -> Watch key metrics
REVIEW   -> Regular check-ins
```

---

## Step 1: Track Everything

**Essential tracking:**

| Category | What to Track | Tool |
|----------|---------------|------|
| Revenue | All income sources | Stripe, accounting |
| Expenses | All costs | Bank, accounting |
| Cash | Bank balance | Bank |
| Receivables | Money owed to you | Invoicing tool |
| Metrics | MRR, churn, CAC | Spreadsheet |

**Revenue tracking:**

| Revenue Type | How to Track |
|--------------|--------------|
| Subscriptions | Stripe dashboard, MRR |
| One-time sales | Payment processor |
| Services | Invoices sent/paid |
| Affiliate/ads | Platform reporting |

**Expense categories:**

| Category | Examples | Typical % |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Infrastructure | Hosting, tools, domains | 5-15% |
| Marketing | Ads, content, tools | 10-30% |
| Operations | Software, services | 5-10% |
| Contractors | Design, dev, support | 10-30% |
| Administrative | Legal, accounting | 2-5% |
| Owner pay | Your salary | Remainder |

---

## Step 2: Understand Unit Economics

**Key metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Healthy Target |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **LTV** | ARPU / Churn rate | > 3x CAC |
| **CAC** | Marketing spend / New customers | < 1/3 LTV |
| **Gross margin** | (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | > 70% (SaaS) |
| **Net margin** | Profit / Revenue | > 20% |
| **Payback period** | CAC / (ARPU x Gross margin) | < 12 months |

**Example calculation:**

```
ARPU = $50/month
Churn = 5%/month
LTV = $50 / 0.05 = $1,000

Ad spend = $5,000
New customers = 50
CAC = $5,000 / 50 = $100

LTV:CAC = $1,000 / $100 = 10:1 (excellent)
```

## Step 3: Simple P&L Model

**Monthly P&L template:**

```markdown
## Monthly P&L

### Revenue
- Subscription: $X
- One-time: $X
- Other: $X
- **Total Revenue: $X**

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
- Hosting: $X
- Transaction fees: $X
- **Total COGS: $X**

### Gross Profit: $X (X%)

### Operating Expenses
- Marketing: $X
- Tools/software: $X
- Contractors: $X
- Other: $X
- **Total OpEx: $X**

### Operating Profit: $X (X%)

### Owner Pay: $X
### Net Profit: $X (X%)
```
