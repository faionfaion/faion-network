## Problem

You're focused on acquiring new customers, but your existing customers are your best revenue opportunity. It costs 5-25x more to acquire a new customer than to sell to an existing one. Yet most solopreneurs leave expansion revenue on the table.

Upselling and cross-selling means growing revenue from customers who already trust you.

---

## Framework

Expansion revenue follows this approach:

```
UNDERSTAND -> Know what else customers need
POSITION   -> Align offers with their goals
TIME       -> Present at the right moment
PROPOSE    -> Make the offer easy
DELIVER    -> Ensure upgraded value
```

### Step 1: Understand the Difference

**Definitions:**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Upselling** | Higher tier of same product | Basic → Pro plan |
| **Cross-selling** | Different/related product | Tool + training course |
| **Expansion** | More of same (seats, usage) | 5 seats → 20 seats |
| **Add-ons** | Additional features | Core + Premium support |

**Revenue impact:**

```
Net Revenue Retention = (Start MRR + Expansion - Churn) / Start MRR

Goal: Net Revenue Retention > 100%
(Expansion offsets churn)
```

### Step 2: Identify Expansion Opportunities

**Upsell triggers:**

| Signal | What It Means | Upsell To |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Hitting limits | Need more capacity | Higher tier |
| Using advanced features | Power user | Pro features |
| Growing team | Need collaboration | Team plan |
| Requesting features | Want more | Premium tier |
| High usage | Getting value | Commit to annual |

**Cross-sell opportunities:**

| Current Product | Related Need | Cross-sell |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Project tool | Communication | Chat add-on |
| Course | Implementation | Coaching |
| Software | Learning | Training |
| One product | Ecosystem | Bundle |

### Step 3: Time It Right

**Good timing:**

| Moment | Why It Works | Offer |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| After first success | High satisfaction | Upgrade to do more |
| Hitting limits | Natural need | Higher tier |
| Business milestone | Celebrating | Premium features |
| Renewal coming | Decision point | Annual upgrade |
| Feature request | Expressed need | Add-on with feature |

**Bad timing:**

| Moment | Why It Fails |
|--------|--------------|
| During support issue | Frustration |
| Before first value | No trust yet |
| Right after purchase | Buyer's remorse |
| During payment failure | Wrong priority |

### Step 4: Position the Offer

**Upsell positioning:**

```
DON'T: "Want to upgrade?"
DO: "You've used 80% of your limit. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited."

DON'T: "Buy our premium plan"
DO: "Based on your usage, you'd save $200/month with annual billing"

DON'T: "Here's what you're missing"
DO: "Here's how you could do [specific thing] faster"
```

**Value-based framing:**

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **ROI** | "Pro saves you 10 hours/month = $500 value" |
| **Comparison** | "For $20 more, you get 10x the capacity" |
| **Social proof** | "Most teams your size use Pro" |
| **Risk reduction** | "Try Pro free for 14 days" |

### Step 5: Make It Easy

**Friction reduction:**

| Friction | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Complex upgrade | One-click upgrade |
| Lose progress | Seamless migration |
| Commitment fear | Trial period |
| Payment hassle | Prorated billing |
| Uncertainty | Clear comparison |

**Upgrade experience:**
```
1. Show clear value difference
2. Highlight what they gain
3. One-click upgrade button
4. Prorate automatically
5. Confirm and celebrate
```
