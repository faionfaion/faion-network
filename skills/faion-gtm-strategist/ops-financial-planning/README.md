## Problem

You know your basic numbers, but you need to plan ahead. How much runway do you have? When should you reinvest profits? What's your emergency fund target? Financial planning means projecting the future and making strategic decisions.

---

## Framework

Financial planning follows this structure:

```
TRACK    -> Know current state (see financial-basics)
FORECAST -> Project the future
DECIDE   -> Make informed choices
REVIEW   -> Adjust based on reality
```

## Step 1: Cash Flow Projection

**3-month cash flow:**

| Month | Starting | Revenue | Expenses | Ending |
|-------|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Jan | $10K | $5K | $4K | $11K |
| Feb | $11K | $6K | $4K | $13K |
| Mar | $13K | $7K | $5K | $15K |

**Annual projection:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Expenses | Profit | Cash |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|------|
| Q1 | $15K | $12K | $3K | $13K |
| Q2 | $20K | $14K | $6K | $19K |
| Q3 | $28K | $18K | $10K | $29K |
| Q4 | $35K | $22K | $13K | $42K |

## Step 2: Plan for Growth

**Reinvestment framework:**

| Profit Level | Reinvestment | Owner Pay | Reserve |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Breakeven | 0% | 0% | 100% |
| < $5K profit | 50% | 30% | 20% |
| $5-15K profit | 40% | 40% | 20% |
| > $15K profit | 30% | 50% | 20% |

**Investment priorities:**

| Priority | Why | Example |
|----------|-----|---------|
| 1. Retention | Keeps revenue | Product improvements |
| 2. Conversion | More customers | Landing page optimization |
| 3. Acquisition | Growth | Ads, content |
| 4. Operations | Efficiency | Tools, automation |
| 5. Expansion | New revenue | New features, products |

---

## Step 3: Financial Safety

**Runway calculation:**

```
Runway = Cash on hand / Monthly burn rate

$30,000 cash / $5,000 monthly expenses = 6 months runway
```

**Safety targets:**

| Stage | Minimum Runway |
|-------|----------------|
| Pre-revenue | 12+ months |
| Early revenue | 6+ months |
| Growing | 3+ months |
| Profitable | 3+ months (emergency fund) |

**Emergency fund:**

```
Target: 3 months of operating expenses
If expenses = $5K/month
Emergency fund = $15K (separate account)
```

## Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Financial Planning

**Situation:** SaaS tool, $10K MRR

**Monthly P&L:**
```
Revenue: $10,000
- Hosting: $500 (5%)
- Transaction fees: $300 (3%)
Gross profit: $9,200 (92%)

- Owner pay: $4,000
Net profit: $1,400 (14%)
```

**Analysis:**
- Healthy gross margin (92%)
- Good operating margin (54%)
- CAC of $100 with LTV of $800 = 8:1 ratio
- 6 months runway

### Example 2: Info Product Business

**Situation:** Online course, variable revenue

**Monthly average:**
```
Revenue: $8,000 (varies $3K-15K)
- Platform fees: $800 (10%)
Gross profit: $7,200 (90%)

- Ads: $1,500 (19%)
- Tools: $200 (3%)
- Content: $500 (6%)
Operating profit: $5,000 (63%)

- Owner pay: $3,500
Net profit: $1,500 (19%)
```

**Analysis:**
- High variability requires larger cash reserve
- Target: 6 months expenses in reserve
