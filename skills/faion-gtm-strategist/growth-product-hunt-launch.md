## Problem

You built something great but nobody knows about it. Product Hunt can bring thousands of engaged users in a single day, but most launches fail. They get lost in the noise, receive few upvotes, and disappear without impact.

A successful Product Hunt launch requires preparation, timing, and community. Random launches almost never work.

---

## Framework

A winning Product Hunt launch has 4 phases:

```
PREPARE   -> Build audience, assets, and hunter network (4-8 weeks before)
OPTIMIZE  -> Perfect your listing, visuals, and copy (1-2 weeks before)
LAUNCH    -> Execute launch day strategy (launch day)
LEVERAGE  -> Maximize post-launch momentum (days after)
```

### Step 1: Prepare (4-8 Weeks Before)

**Build your hunter network:**
- Follow and engage with top hunters
- Request hunt from someone with 1,000+ followers
- If self-hunting, build your own follower base first

**Create anticipation:**
- Build email list of interested users
- Engage in communities (IndieHackers, X, Reddit)
- Create "coming soon" page with waitlist
- Share build-in-public updates

**Target audience:**
- Product Hunt followers are tech-savvy, early adopters
- They want new, innovative, beautifully designed products
- They appreciate makers who engage authentically

### Step 2: Optimize (1-2 Weeks Before)

**Listing elements:**

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| **Tagline** | <60 chars, benefit-focused, no jargon |
| **Description** | First 2 lines hook, then features+benefits |
| **Thumbnail** | Eye-catching, shows product, works at small size |
| **Gallery** | 4-6 images: hero, features, social proof |
| **Video** | 1-2 min max, show product in action |
| **First comment** | Thank hunter, share backstory, offer deal |

**Tagline formula:**
```
[Action verb] [outcome] [for whom] [differentiator]

Examples:
- "Build beautiful landing pages in minutes"
- "Track habits with AI-powered reminders"
- "Ship faster with automated testing"
```

**Gallery best practices:**
- First image: Hero shot with tagline
- Images 2-4: Key features with explanations
- Image 5: Testimonials or social proof
- Image 6: Call-to-action or pricing

### Step 3: Launch (Launch Day)

**Timing:**
- Launch at 12:01 AM PT (midnight Pacific)
- This gives full 24 hours in the ranking period
- Tuesdays-Thursdays are best (more active users)
- Avoid major holidays and Apple events

**Launch day schedule:**

| Time (PT) | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 12:01 AM | Post goes live, first comment ready |
| 6:00 AM | Send email to supporters |
| 9:00 AM | Post on social media |
| 12:00 PM | Engage with all comments |
| 3:00 PM | Second social push |
| 6:00 PM | Thank you post, community outreach |
| 9:00 PM | Final engagement push |

**Engagement rules:**
- Respond to EVERY comment (within 1 hour)
- Be authentic, grateful, and helpful
- Never ask for upvotes directly (against TOS)
- Answer questions thoroughly
- Accept feedback gracefully

### Step 4: Leverage (Post-Launch)

**Within 24 hours:**
- Thank supporters publicly
- Share final ranking and stats
- Collect testimonials from commenters

**Within 1 week:**
- Blog post about the launch learnings
- Nurture new email subscribers
- Follow up with interested users

**Long-term:**
- Add "Featured on Product Hunt" badge
- Include in press kit
- Use for social proof
