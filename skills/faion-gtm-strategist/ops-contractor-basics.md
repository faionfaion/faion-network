## Problem

You're doing everything yourself. Design, development, content, support. You're maxed out, and growth has stalled. You need help, but you don't know how to hire, what to pay, or how to manage contractors.

Hiring contractors means getting skilled help without the overhead of employees.

---

## Framework

Contractor hiring follows this process:

```
IDENTIFY  -> Know what to delegate
FIND      -> Source quality candidates
EVALUATE  -> Assess skills and fit
ONBOARD   -> Set up for success
MANAGE    -> Get results consistently
```

### Step 1: Identify What to Delegate

**Delegation matrix:**

| Task Type | Delegate? | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Core competency | No | Your competitive advantage |
| Specialized skills | Yes | Others do it better |
| Time-consuming | Yes | Free your time |
| Repetitive | Yes | Automate or delegate |
| High-leverage | Maybe | Train someone trustworthy |

**Common contractor roles for solopreneurs:**

| Role | Tasks | Typical Rate |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Virtual assistant | Admin, scheduling, research | $10-30/hr |
| Designer | Graphics, UI, branding | $30-100/hr |
| Developer | Code, integrations | $50-150/hr |
| Writer | Content, copy, docs | $30-100/hr |
| Video editor | Video production | $25-75/hr |
| Support agent | Customer support | $15-35/hr |
| Marketing | Ads, SEO, social | $40-150/hr |

**ROI calculation:**
```
Your hourly rate: $100/hr (based on income goals)
Task takes you: 5 hours/week = $500 value
Contractor rate: $30/hr x 5 = $150/week

Savings: $350/week = $18,200/year
Plus: You focus on higher-value work
```

### Step 2: Find Quality Contractors

**Sourcing channels:**

| Source | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Upwork** | Large pool, escrow, reviews | Competition, fees |
| **Fiverr** | Fast, affordable | Variable quality |
| **Toptal** | Pre-vetted, high quality | Expensive |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional network | No platform protection |
| **Referrals** | Trusted recommendations | Limited pool |
| **Twitter/X** | Niche communities | Unvetted |

## Contractor vs Employee

| Factor | Contractor | Employee |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Control | What, not how | Direct control |
| Schedule | Flexible | Set hours |
| Tools | Own tools | Company provides |
| Benefits | None required | Required |
| Taxes | They pay | You withhold |
| Termination | Per contract | More restrictions |

**Stay compliant:** Treat contractors as contractors. Don't treat them like employees or risk misclassification.
