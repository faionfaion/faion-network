## Product Explainability

### Problem

AI-mediated discovery changes how products are found and evaluated.

### Solution: Design for AI Understanding

**Product Explainability Defined:**
How clearly a product communicates its purpose, value, behavior, and limits to people AND to AI systems.

**Why It Matters 2026:**
- Search, recommendations happen through AI answers
- Buying guidance is AI-mediated
- Products need representation without human mediation

**Explainability Components:**

| Component | For Humans | For AI |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Purpose | Clear value proposition | Structured metadata |
| Capabilities | Feature documentation | Schema markup |
| Limitations | Honest scope definition | Constraint documentation |
| Use Cases | Customer stories | Semantic tagging |

**Implementation Checklist:**
```
[ ] Product knowledge base aligned with actual product
[ ] Structured data for AI consumption
[ ] Clear capability boundaries documented
[ ] Use case scenarios tagged and indexed
[ ] Regular sync between product and documentation
```

**Key Insight 2026:** Keeping the product knowledge base aligned with the product itself is essential for AI-mediated consideration and discovery.
