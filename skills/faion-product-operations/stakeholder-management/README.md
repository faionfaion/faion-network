## Problem

Products fail due to stakeholder misalignment, not technology. Common issues:
- Conflicting requirements from different stakeholders
- Last-minute changes from executives
- Silent stakeholders who block later
- Unclear decision-making authority

**The root cause:** No systematic approach to identifying, engaging, and managing stakeholders.

## Framework

### What is Stakeholder Management?

Stakeholder management is identifying everyone affected by your product, understanding their needs, and keeping them appropriately engaged. It answers: "Who matters and how do we work with them?"

### Stakeholder Identification

#### 1. Who Are Stakeholders?

| Type | Examples | Needs |
|------|----------|-------|
| End Users | Customers, employees | Value from product |
| Decision Makers | Executives, sponsors | Business outcomes |
| Influencers | Advisors, thought leaders | Credibility, early access |
| Builders | Developers, designers | Clear requirements |
| Support | Customer success, sales | Product knowledge |
| External | Partners, regulators | Compliance, compatibility |

#### 2. Stakeholder Mapping

**Power/Interest Grid:**

```
          INTEREST
          High      Low
     High │ Manage   │ Keep
POWER     │ Closely  │ Satisfied
     Low  │ Keep     │ Monitor
          │ Informed │
```

**Categories:**
- **High Power, High Interest:** Engage deeply, regular updates
- **High Power, Low Interest:** Keep satisfied, periodic updates
- **Low Power, High Interest:** Keep informed, involve in feedback
- **Low Power, Low Interest:** Monitor, minimal effort

### Stakeholder Engagement

#### Level of Engagement

| Level | Description | Tactics |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Partner | Active collaboration | Co-creation, regular meetings |
| Involved | Regular input | Reviews, feedback sessions |
| Informed | One-way updates | Newsletters, demos |
| Monitor | Minimal contact | Periodic check-ins |

### Stakeholder Management Process

#### Step 1: Identify All Stakeholders

**Brainstorm:**
- Who uses this?
- Who pays for this?
- Who approves this?
- Who builds this?
- Who supports this?
- Who could block this?

#### Step 2: Analyze Each Stakeholder

**For each:**
- What do they want?
- What do they fear?
- How much power do they have?
- How interested are they?
- What's their attitude (supporter/neutral/resistor)?

#### Step 3: Plan Engagement

**Based on analysis:**
- How often to communicate
- What format (meeting, email, doc)
- What information they need
- Who manages the relationship

#### Step 4: Execute and Adapt

- Regular touchpoints
- Track satisfaction
- Adjust as dynamics change
- Handle conflicts proactively
