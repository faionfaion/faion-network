# Feedback Management

## Metadata

## Problem

Feedback is collected but not acted upon systematically. Issues:
- Feedback scattered across channels
- Loudest voices dominate decisions
- No way to measure feedback impact
- Users feel unheard

**The root cause:** No structured system for collecting, organizing, and acting on feedback.

## Framework

### What is Feedback Management?

Feedback management is the systematic collection, categorization, prioritization, and response to user input. It answers: "What are users telling us and what should we do about it?"

### Feedback Sources

| Source | Type | Volume | Quality |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| Support tickets | Reactive | High | High (real issues) |
| In-app feedback | Prompted | Medium | Medium |
| App store reviews | Public | Medium | Mixed |
| Social media | Unsolicited | Variable | Variable |
| Sales calls | Prospects | Low | High |
| NPS surveys | Prompted | Medium | Medium |
| User interviews | Solicited | Low | Very High |
| Analytics | Behavioral | High | High (for patterns) |

### Feedback Processing Pipeline

```
COLLECT → CATEGORIZE → ANALYZE → PRIORITIZE → ACT → CLOSE LOOP
    ↓          ↓           ↓          ↓         ↓         ↓
 Sources    Taxonomy    Patterns    RICE     Build    Respond
```

### Feedback Categorization

#### By Type

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Bug | Something's broken | "Can't save settings" |
| Feature request | New capability | "Need PDF export" |
| Enhancement | Improve existing | "Make it faster" |
| Confusion | UX issue | "Where do I find X?" |
| Praise | Positive feedback | "Love this feature!" |
| Complaint | Negative sentiment | "Frustrated with..." |

#### By Topic

Create a taxonomy specific to your product:
- Onboarding
- Core feature A
- Core feature B
- Billing
- Integrations
- Performance
- etc.

### Feedback Management Process

#### Step 1: Centralize Collection

**Single source of truth:**
- Tool: ProductBoard, Canny, Notion, Linear
- Or: Spreadsheet/database

**Auto-import from:**
- Support tickets (tag with feedback)
- In-app widget
- Email alias (feedback@)
- Social monitoring

#### Step 2: Triage and Categorize

**For each piece of feedback:**
- Type (bug/request/enhancement)
- Topic (category)
- Source (where it came from)
- Segment (who said it)
- Sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)

#### Step 3: Aggregate and Analyze

**Regularly review:**
- Volume by category
- Trends over time
- Top requests by votes/mentions
- Correlation with segments

#### Step 4: Prioritize

**Connect to product process:**
- Link feedback to backlog items
- Use RICE or other prioritization
- Consider segment importance
- Factor in strategic goals

#### Step 5: Act

**For each decision:**
- Build it (add to roadmap)
- Won't do (document why)
- Need more info (research)
- Already planned (link to roadmap)

#### Step 6: Close the Loop

**Tell users what happened:**
- Email updates on shipped features
- "You asked, we delivered" posts
- Individual responses when possible
- Changelog/release notes
