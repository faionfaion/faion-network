## Problem

Teams struggle to align on what's essential vs. optional. Common issues:
- Everything marked as "high priority"
- No clear trade-off discussions
- Scope creep from "nice to haves"
- Stakeholder conflicts on what matters

**The root cause:** No shared vocabulary for priority levels.

---

## Framework

### What is MoSCoW?

MoSCoW is a prioritization technique that categorizes requirements into four buckets:
- **M**ust Have
- **S**hould Have
- **C**ould Have
- **W**on't Have

### Category Definitions

#### Must Have (M)

**Definition:** Non-negotiable for this release. Without these, the product is not viable.

**Test questions:**
- Will it fail completely without this?
- Is there no workaround?
- Is it legally/contractually required?

**Target:** 60% of effort

**Examples:**
- User authentication for a SaaS
- Payment processing for e-commerce
- Core value proposition feature

#### Should Have (S)

**Definition:** Important but not critical. Has workarounds, can wait briefly.

**Test questions:**
- Is it painful but workable without?
- Can users accomplish goals with workarounds?
- Will it significantly improve experience?

**Target:** 20% of effort

**Examples:**
- Password reset (can use support workaround)
- Search/filter (can scroll manually)
- Notifications (can check manually)

#### Could Have (C)

**Definition:** Nice to have. Low cost to include if time permits.

**Test questions:**
- Is it a minor enhancement?
- Does lack of it not affect core function?
- Is it a delight feature, not necessity?

**Target:** 20% of effort (but first to cut)

**Examples:**
- Dark mode
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Cosmetic improvements
- Secondary integrations

#### Won't Have (W)

**Definition:** Explicitly not in this release. Documented for clarity.

**Why document:**
- Prevents scope creep
- Sets clear expectations
- Saves for future consideration
- Focuses discussions

**Examples:**
- Mobile app (web first)
- Team features (solo focus)
- Advanced analytics (basic first)

### MoSCoW Process

#### Step 1: List All Requirements

Gather everything from:
- Stakeholder requests
- User research
- Technical needs
- Competitive analysis

#### Step 2: Define the Timebox

**Critical:** MoSCoW requires fixed constraints:
- Time: "This sprint" or "This quarter"
- Resources: Team capacity
- Budget: If applicable

#### Step 3: Initial Categorization

For each item, ask:
1. "If we don't have this, does the product work?" → Must if No
2. "Is there a reasonable workaround?" → Should if No
3. "Is this nice but not needed?" → Could
4. "Is this out of scope for this release?" → Won't

#### Step 4: Validate Effort Allocation

Check proportions:
- Must + Should ≤ 80% of capacity
- Buffer 20% for Could or overflow

**If over budget:**
- Move Should to Could
- Move Could to Won't
- NEVER move Must to Should

#### Step 5: Stakeholder Alignment

Review with stakeholders:
- Share categorization
- Discuss disagreements
- Document decisions

#### Step 6: Lock and Track

Once agreed:
- Lock Must Have (change requires escalation)
- Lock Won't Have (prevents scope creep)
- Should/Could can flex

| Everything is Must | Apply strict test: fails without it? |
| No Won't category | Always document exclusions |
| Ignoring effort | Check proportions against capacity |
| Changing Must mid-sprint | Require escalation for changes |
| Not involving stakeholders | Collaborative exercise |
| Vague requirements | Make each item specific and testable |
| No timebox | MoSCoW needs fixed constraints |
