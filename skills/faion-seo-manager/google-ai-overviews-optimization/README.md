## google-ai-overviews-optimization: Google AI Overviews Optimization

### Problem

Google AI Overviews reach 2 billion monthly users. 30% of searches trigger AI Overviews. How to get featured?

### Solution: Structure for AI Extraction

**Current State:**
- 2B monthly users see AI Overviews
- Science queries: 25.96% have AI Overviews (highest)
- Computers & Electronics: 17.92%
- People & Society: 17.29%
- Ads alongside AI Overviews: 3% -> 40% (Jan-Nov 2025)

**Optimization Principles:**
```
Old: Write more content
New: Write content easy to extract, verify, summarize
```

**Key Strategies:**

1. **Content Structure**
   - Clear entity relationships and semantic clarity
   - If AI can't map content to specific entity/fact, it won't cite you
   - Concise answers immediately after headings
   - Proper heading hierarchy (H1->H2->H3)

2. **Schema Markup**
   - Article and FAQ schema (+28% AI citations)
   - Helps AI understand what content is, who created it
   - Connect elements clearly

3. **Freshness**
   - Content updated within 30 days = 3.2x more citations
   - Keep statistics and data current

4. **Authority Signals**
   - Cross-platform presence
   - Citation relationships with trusted sources
   - Earned media from reputable outlets
   - Positive customer reviews

**Google AI Mode vs AI Overviews:**

| Feature | AI Overviews | AI Mode |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Response | Single-pass synthesis | Multi-turn iterative |
| Sources | Limited | More diverse |
| Speed | Optimized for speed | Deeper exploration |
| Use case | Quick answers | Complex queries |

**Tracking Performance:**
- Google Search Console (AI Overview data since June 2025)
- Semrush AI Toolkit
- Otterly.AI, Profound for dedicated tracking
- Manual sampling + automated tools

**Industries Most Impacted:**
High AI Overview presence = more optimization needed:
- Science, Technology, Health
- Computers & Electronics
