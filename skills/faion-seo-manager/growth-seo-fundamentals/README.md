## Problem

You want free, sustainable traffic but don't understand how search engines work. Without SEO, you miss 53% of all website traffic that comes from organic search.

Most SEO advice is outdated or wrong. You waste months on tactics that don't work while competitors rank for your keywords.

---

## Framework

SEO has 3 pillars:

```
Technical SEO  → Can Google crawl and index your site?
On-Page SEO    → Does your content match search intent?
Off-Page SEO   → Do other sites trust and link to you?
```

### Pillar 1: Technical SEO

**Critical technical factors:**

| Factor | What to Check | Tool |
|--------|---------------|------|
| **Crawlability** | robots.txt allows crawling | Search Console |
| **Indexability** | Pages in Google index | site:domain.com |
| **Site speed** | Core Web Vitals pass | PageSpeed Insights |
| **Mobile** | Mobile-friendly | Mobile-Friendly Test |
| **HTTPS** | SSL certificate | Browser |
| **Structure** | XML sitemap exists | /sitemap.xml |

**Technical checklist:**
