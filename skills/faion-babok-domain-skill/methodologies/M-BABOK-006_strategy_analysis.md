## Problem

Projects start without understanding why. Solutions are built without connecting to business goals. After delivery, nobody can explain the business value. Initiatives compete for resources without clear prioritization criteria. The gap between strategy and execution is wide.

Without strategy analysis:
- Solutions disconnected from goals
- Unclear business value
- Poor initiative prioritization
- Wasted resources
