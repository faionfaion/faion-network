# Opportunity Solution Trees (OST)

## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Facilitate OST brainstorming session | sonnet | Medium-complexity collaborative framework facilitation |
| Map outcomes to opportunities | sonnet | Analysis of business goals and customer needs |
| Generate solution alternatives | sonnet | Creative synthesis of potential approaches |
| Design experiments for testing | sonnet | Planning and structured validation approach |
| Build OST visual diagram | haiku | Mechanical diagram generation from structured data |

## Problem

Teams lack structured framework for connecting outcomes to solutions.

## Solution: Visual Discovery Framework

**OST Components:**
```
Outcome (Business/Product Goal)
    |
    +-- Opportunity 1 (Customer Need/Pain Point)
    |       +-- Solution A
    |       |       +-- Experiment 1
    |       |       +-- Experiment 2
    |       +-- Solution B
    |               +-- Experiment 3
    |
    +-- Opportunity 2
    |       +-- Solution C
    |       +-- Solution D
    |
    +-- Opportunity 3
            +-- Solution E
```

**OST Benefits:**
- Visualizes discovery thinking
- Aligns team around what to do
- Charts path to desired outcome
- Manages messy discovery cycles
- Creates shared understanding

**OST Best Practices:**
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Build collaboratively as team | Create in isolation |
| Update regularly | Treat as static document |
| Focus on opportunities before solutions | Jump to solutions first |
| Test assumptions with experiments | Build without validation |

**Tools:** Miro OST Template, FigJam, Whimsical
