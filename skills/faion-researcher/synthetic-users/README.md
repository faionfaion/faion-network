# Synthetic Users

## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Create synthetic user profiles | sonnet | Medium-complexity profile generation |
| Generate synthetic research responses | haiku | Pattern-based response generation |
| Validate synthetic findings with real data | opus | Complex comparison and validation logic |
| Create governance framework for synthetic users | opus | Complex policy and decision architecture |
| Document synthetic user limitations | sonnet | Medium-complexity analysis and documentation |

## Problem

Real user research is slow and expensive for early validation.

## Solution: AI-Generated Research Participants (with Limitations)

**What Are Synthetic Users?**
AI-generated profiles that mimic user groups, providing artificial research findings without studying real users.

**Key Tools:**
| Tool | Capability |
|------|-----------|
| Synthetic Users | Realistic persona generation |
| SyntheticAudience.ai | Quantitative research at scale |
| Viewpoints.ai | Rapid concept validation |
| UserIntelligence | Simulation engine for directional insights |
| Qualtrics Edge Audience | Modeled audience layers |
| Aaru | Scenario testing, predictive analysis |

**Valid Use Cases:**
| Good For | Not Good For |
|----------|--------------|
| Early ideation | Go/no-go decisions |
| Hypothesis generation | Demand forecasting |
| Rapid concept testing | Final validation |
| Low-risk exploration | High-stakes decisions |
| When no research baseline exists | Replacing human research |

**Validation Framework:**
```
Synthetic Research -> Real User Validation -> Decision
       |                     |
   Directional          Confirmatory
   (Fast, cheap)        (Accurate, reliable)
```

**Key Limitations:**
- Cannot replace depth/empathy from real users
- Often provide shallow or favorable feedback
- Minor training changes produce different results
- No industry standards for quality testing
- Cannot understand nonverbal/behavioral cues

**Governance Best Practices:**
- Never use for go/no-go without human validation
- Define persona retirement schedule
- Assign ownership for persona accuracy
- Aim for "synthetic-organic parity" validation

**Market Insight:** Single greatest barrier to adoption is "crisis of trust" due to data quality, bias, and hallucination concerns. Emerging "Validation-as-a-Service" (VaaS) providers addressing this gap.
