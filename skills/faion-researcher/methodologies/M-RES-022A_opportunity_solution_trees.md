## M-RES-022A: Opportunity Solution Trees (OST)

### Problem

Teams lack structured framework for connecting outcomes to solutions.

### Solution: Visual Discovery Framework

**OST Components:**
```
Outcome (Business/Product Goal)
    |
    - Opportunity 1 (Customer Need/Pain Point)
            - Solution A
                    - Experiment 1
                    - Experiment 2
            - Solution B
                    - Experiment 3
    |
    - Opportunity 2
            - Solution C
            - Solution D
    |
    - Opportunity 3
            - Solution E
```

**OST Benefits:**
- Visualizes discovery thinking
- Aligns team around what to do
- Charts path to desired outcome
- Manages messy discovery cycles
- Creates shared understanding

**OST Best Practices:**
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Build collaboratively as team | Create in isolation |
| Update regularly | Treat as static document |
| Focus on opportunities before solutions | Jump to solutions first |
| Test assumptions with experiments | Build without validation |

**Tools:** Miro OST Template, FigJam, Whimsical
