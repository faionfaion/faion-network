## Problem

Entrepreneurs say "everyone is my customer" or create fictional personas with stock photos and made-up details. Problems:
- Too broad targeting = weak messaging
- Fictional personas = wrong assumptions
- No validation = building for nobody
- Persona never updated = stale understanding

**The root cause:** Personas built from imagination, not research.

## Framework

### What is a Persona?

A persona is a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer based on real data. It helps make product, marketing, and sales decisions by answering: "Who exactly are we serving?"

### The Persona Building Process

#### Step 1: Gather Real Data

**Data sources:**

| Source | What to Extract |
|--------|-----------------|
| Interviews | Goals, frustrations, workflow |
| Surveys | Demographics, tool usage |
| Analytics | Behavior, engagement |
| Support tickets | Problems, language used |
| Social media | Interests, how they talk |
| Sales calls | Objections, motivations |

**Minimum:** 10 customer interviews before creating persona.

#### Step 2: Identify Patterns

Cluster interview findings:

| Dimension | Common Patterns |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Role/title | "Freelance designer", "Solo founder" |
| Goals | "Get more clients", "Save time" |
| Frustrations | "Too many tools", "Unpredictable income" |
| Behaviors | "Uses Notion", "Active on Twitter" |
| Buying | "Tries free first", "Needs social proof" |

#### Step 3: Define Persona Segments

Most products have 2-4 personas:

| Persona | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Primary | Main buyer, most revenue | Focus here |
| Secondary | Important but smaller | Support |
| Negative | Who NOT to target | Avoid |

**Rule:** Start with ONE primary persona. Add others only after traction.

#### Step 4: Build the Persona

**Essential elements:**

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Name | Memorable, realistic | "Freelance Fiona" |
| Role | Job title/situation | "Independent UX designer" |
| Demographics | Age, location, income | "32, NYC, $80K/year" |
| Goals | What they want to achieve | "Land 3 retainer clients" |
| Frustrations | What blocks them | "Feast or famine income" |
| Behaviors | How they work/buy | "Research heavily before buying" |
| Quote | Characteristic saying | "I need simplicity, not features" |

**Advanced elements:**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Day in the life | Typical workflow |
| Tools used | Current software stack |
| Information sources | Where they learn |
| Objections | Why they wouldn't buy |
| Buying trigger | What makes them act |

#### Step 5: Validate and Update

**Validation methods:**
- Show persona to actual customers - do they recognize themselves?
- Compare persona predictions with real behavior
- Test messaging tailored to persona

**Update frequency:**
- Major update: Quarterly
- Minor tweaks: As you learn
- Full rebuild: After pivot or new market
