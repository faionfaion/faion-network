1. **Metadata** - ID, category, difficulty, tags, agents
2. **Problem** - What issue this solves
3. **Framework** - Core concepts and process
4. **Templates** - Ready-to-use documents
5. **Examples** - Real-world applications
6. **Common Mistakes** - Pitfalls and fixes
7. **Related Methodologies** - Cross-references
8. **Agent** - Which agent implements this
