## M-RES-024: AI-Assisted Persona Building

### Problem

Personas based on assumptions, not data.

### Solution: Data-Driven Personas

**AI-Enhanced Persona Process:**
```
1. Aggregate user data (analytics, interviews, surveys)
2. AI clustering of behavioral patterns
3. AI-generated persona drafts
4. Human validation and refinement
5. Ongoing persona updates from new data
```

**Modern Persona Components:**

| Section | Traditional | 2026 Addition |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Demographics | Age, location | Digital behavior |
| Goals | What they want | JTBD framework |
| Pain points | Frustrations | Quantified impact |
| Behavior | How they act | Trigger analysis |
| Quotes | Representative | Sentiment patterns |

**JTBD Integration:**
```
When [situation],
I want to [motivation],
So I can [expected outcome].
```
