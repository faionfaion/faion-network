## Problem

"If you build it, they will come" is a myth. Common distribution failures:
- No clear channel strategy
- Trying all channels at once
- Picking channels based on preference, not fit
- No understanding of channel economics

**The root cause:** Not researching how customers actually discover and adopt products.

### Channel Research Process

#### Step 1: Map Customer Discovery

**Research questions:**
- Where does your target audience hang out online?
- What do they read/watch/listen to?
- How did they find current solutions?
- What influences their decisions?

**Data sources:**
- Customer interviews: "How did you hear about us?"
- Survey: "Where do you discover new tools?"
- Analytics: "What's our traffic source?"
- Competitor analysis: "Where do they advertise?"

#### Step 2: Evaluate Channel Fit

**Channel-Product Fit Matrix:**

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Audience presence | 25% | |
| Competitors using | 15% | |
| Cost to test | 20% | |
| Time to results | 15% | |
| Scalability | 15% | |
| Team capability | 10% | |

**Score each channel, prioritize highest scorers.**

#### Step 3: Model Channel Economics

**Per channel:**
```
Cost per impression: $X
Click-through rate: X%
Cost per click: $X
Conversion rate: X%
Cost per acquisition: $X
Customer lifetime value: $X
LTV:CAC: X:1
```

**Viable channel:** LTV:CAC > 3:1

#### Step 4: Test and Validate

**Testing framework:**
1. **Micro-test:** $100-500, 1-2 weeks
2. **Validate:** Did we get signal?
3. **Scale test:** $1-5K, 1 month
4. **Optimize:** Improve conversion
5. **Scale:** Increase budget

**Success criteria:**
- CAC within target
- Quality of leads acceptable
- Channel is scalable

#### Step 5: Build Channel Mix

**Portfolio approach:**

| Stage | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| 0-$10K MRR | 1 channel, master it |
| $10-50K MRR | 2-3 channels |
| $50K+ MRR | Diversified mix |

**Rule:** 80% effort on 1-2 proven channels, 20% on experiments.
