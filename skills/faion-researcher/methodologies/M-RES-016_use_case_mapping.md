## Problem

Products get built without clear understanding of how users will actually use them. Issues:
- Features disconnected from real workflows
- Missing critical paths users need
- Edge cases overlooked until production
- No shared understanding across team

**The root cause:** No documented mapping between user goals and system behavior.

---

## Framework

### What is Use Case Mapping?

Use case mapping is documenting specific ways users interact with your product to achieve goals. It answers: "What exactly will users do with this?"

### Use Case Components

**Essential elements:**

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Actor | Who performs the action | Freelancer, Admin, Guest |
| Goal | What they want to achieve | Create an invoice |
| Preconditions | What must be true before | User is logged in |
| Main Flow | Happy path steps | Step 1, 2, 3... |
| Alternative Flows | Variations | If payment fails... |
| Postconditions | Result when complete | Invoice sent |

### Use Case Discovery Process

#### Step 1: Identify Actors

**Actor types:**

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Primary | Main beneficiary | Customer, user |
| Secondary | Supports process | Admin, moderator |
| External | System actors | Payment gateway, API |

**Questions:**
- Who will use this system?
- Who benefits from it?
- Who administers it?
- What external systems interact?

#### Step 2: List Goals

For each actor, identify goals:

**Template:**
```
Actor: [Name]
Goals:
1. [Primary goal 1]
2. [Primary goal 2]
3. [Secondary goal 1]
```

**Goal levels:**

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Summary | High-level objective | Manage business finances |
| User | Specific session goal | Create invoice for client |
| Subfunction | Sub-step within goal | Add line item |

#### Step 3: Map Main Flows

For each use case, document the happy path:

```
Use Case: [Name]
Actor: [Who]
Goal: [What they want]

Preconditions:
- [Condition 1]
- [Condition 2]

Main Flow:
1. Actor [action]
2. System [response]
3. Actor [action]
4. System [response]
5. [Continue...]

Postconditions:
- [Result 1]
- [Result 2]
```

#### Step 4: Identify Alternatives

**Types of alternative flows:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Extension | Additional options | "2a. If large file, show progress" |
| Exception | Error handling | "3a. If validation fails, show error" |
| Branch | Different path | "4a. If recurring, set schedule" |

#### Step 5: Create Use Case Diagram

Visual representation:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              SYSTEM                      │
│                                          │
│    (Use Case 1)  ────── (Use Case 2)    │
│         │                    │           │
│         │                    │           │
└─────────│────────────────────│───────────┘
          │                    │
     ┌────┴────┐          ┌────┴────┐
     │  Actor  │          │  Actor  │
     │    A    │          │    B    │
     └─────────┘          └─────────┘
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too vague | Be specific about each step |
| Missing alternatives | Always document error cases |
| System-centric | Write from actor's perspective |
| Too detailed | Stay at user goal level |
| No preconditions | Always state what must be true |
| Skipping validation | Review with actual users |
