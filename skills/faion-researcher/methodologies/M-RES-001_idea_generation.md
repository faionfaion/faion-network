## Problem

Most aspiring solopreneurs get stuck at "I don't have any good ideas." They either:
- Wait for inspiration that never comes
- Chase trending topics without personal fit
- Pick random ideas without systematic evaluation
- Give up before even starting

**The root cause:** No structured framework for generating viable business ideas.

## Framework

### What is Idea Generation?

Idea generation is a systematic process of discovering business opportunities by combining your skills, market needs, and personal interests. It's not about waiting for a "eureka" moment.

### The 7 Idea Generation Frameworks

#### 1. Skills Inventory Framework

Map what you already know:

```
My Skills:
- Technical: [Python, SQL, APIs...]
- Domain: [Marketing, Finance, Healthcare...]
- Soft: [Writing, Teaching, Consulting...]

Question: What problems can I solve with these skills?
```

**Example:**
- Skill: Python + Marketing
- Idea: "Automated social media analytics tool for small businesses"

#### 2. Pain Point Mining

Look for complaints in:
- Reddit threads (sort by "top" in niche subreddits)
- Twitter/X rants
- App store reviews (1-2 star)
- Quora questions
- Forum complaints

**Template:**
```markdown
Pain Point: [What people complain about]
Frequency: [How often mentioned]
Current Solutions: [What exists]
Gap: [What's missing]
Idea: [Your solution]
```

#### 3. Job Substitution Framework

List tedious tasks people pay others to do:
- What do freelancers on Upwork/Fiverr do repeatedly?
- What tasks do small businesses outsource?
- What manual work could be automated?

**Idea formula:** "Automate [repetitive task] for [specific audience]"

#### 4. Productized Service Framework

Turn services into products:
1. Find a service you or others provide
2. Identify the repeatable part
3. Package it as a product

**Examples:**
- Consulting → Course
- Custom development → SaaS template
- Design work → Design system

#### 5. Unbundling Framework

Break existing platforms into focused tools:
- Excel → [specific use case tool]
- Notion → [focused app]
- Salesforce → [simpler CRM]

**Question:** "What do people use [big platform] for that deserves its own tool?"

#### 6. Market Stacking

Combine two niches:
- Niche A × Niche B = New opportunity

**Examples:**
- AI × Legal = Contract analysis
- Fitness × Remote work = Home workout for developers
- Crypto × Freelancing = Payment platform

#### 7. Your Own Problems

Document problems you face daily:
- What tools do you wish existed?
- What workflows frustrate you?
- What did you build for yourself?

**Rule:** If you have the problem, others likely do too.

### Idea Scoring Matrix

Rate each idea 1-5:

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| Market Size | 20% | ? | |

| Monetization | 20% | ? | |
