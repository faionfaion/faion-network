## Continuous Discovery

### Problem

Discovery treated as one-time project start activity.

### Solution: Ongoing Discovery Integration (Teresa Torres Framework)

**Continuous Discovery Habits:**

| Cadence | Activity | Output |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Daily | Review analytics, support tickets | Insight log |
| Weekly | User interviews (2-3) | Interview notes |
| Weekly | Competitor monitoring | Change log |
| Weekly | Assumption testing | Validated/invalidated assumptions |
| Bi-weekly | Synthesis session | Updated assumptions |
| Monthly | Research review | Research report |

**Teresa Torres 2025-2026 Updates:**
- Launched two new podcasts
- Built AI products for discovery workflows
- Integrated Claude Code into work processes
- Trained 18,000+ people in product discovery

**Product Trio Model:**
```
Product Manager + Designer + Engineer
        |
Weekly customer interviews (uncover opportunities)
        +
Weekly assumption testing (evaluate solutions)
        |
Avoid "curse of knowledge" bias
```

**Integration with Product:**
```
Discovery -> Hypothesis -> Experiment -> Learn -> Repeat
     ^                                         |
     |-----------------------------------------|
```

**Key Principle:** Markets change fast, user needs evolve. Solutions that worked 6 months ago may not work today.

**Tools for Continuous Discovery:**
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Dovetail | Research repository |
| Notion | Knowledge base |
| Airtable | Insight tracking |
| EnjoyHQ | Research ops |
| Condens | Synthesis |
| Looppanel | AI interview analysis |
