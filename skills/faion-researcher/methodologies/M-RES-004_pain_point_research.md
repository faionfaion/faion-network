## Problem

Finding pain points manually is time-consuming and hit-or-miss. Entrepreneurs often:
- Look in the wrong places
- Misinterpret complaints as problems
- Miss hidden pain points beneath surface issues
- Don't categorize or prioritize findings

**The root cause:** No systematic approach to discovering and organizing pain points.

---

## Framework

### What is Pain Point Research?

Pain point research is the systematic discovery and categorization of problems that cause frustration, waste time, or cost money for a specific audience.

### The Pain Point Discovery Framework

#### Step 1: Define Your Research Scope

**Template:**
```
Audience: [Specific group]
Context: [Situation/workflow]
Domain: [Industry/area]
Goal: Find [X] pain points in [Y] hours
```

**Example:**
- Audience: Freelance web developers
- Context: Client project management
- Domain: Remote services
- Goal: Find 20 pain points in 4 hours

#### Step 2: Mine Pain Point Sources

**Tier 1: Direct Complaints (Highest Signal)**

| Source | How to Search | What to Find |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Reddit | r/[niche] + sort by top/controversial | "I hate when...", "Frustrated with..." |
| Twitter/X | "[topic] sucks" OR "[topic] frustrating" | Rants, complaints |
| Product Hunt | Read negative reviews | Feature gaps, UX issues |
| G2/Capterra | 1-3 star reviews | Why people left/hate product |
| App Store | Filter by recent 1-2 stars | Specific grievances |

**Tier 2: Questions (Problem Indicators)**

| Source | How to Search | What to Find |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Quora | "[topic] how to" | What people can't figure out |
| Stack Overflow | [tag] + closed as duplicate | Recurring issues |
| Subreddit wikis | FAQ sections | Most asked questions |
| Google "People Also Ask" | Search [topic] | Common confusions |

**Tier 3: Forums & Communities**

| Source | How to Access | What to Find |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Slack groups | Join niche communities | Daily struggles |
| Discord servers | Search for [niche] discord | Real-time problems |
| Facebook groups | Search and join | Lengthy complaint posts |
| Indie Hackers | Browse discussions | Founder problems |

**Tier 4: Jobs & Gigs**

| Source | How to Search | What to Find |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Upwork | Browse job posts | What people outsource |
| Fiverr | Popular gigs | Repetitive needs |
| LinkedIn Jobs | "looking for someone to" | Manual work needs |

#### Step 3: Categorize Pain Points

**Pain Point Categories:**

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Time Waste | Takes too long to do X | "Spend 2 hours updating reports" |
| Money Loss | Costs more than it should | "Paying $200/mo for features I don't use" |
| Complexity | Too hard to understand | "Can't figure out the settings" |
| Integration | Tools don't work together | "Have to copy-paste between apps" |
| Reliability | Doesn't work consistently | "It crashes every other day" |
| Support | Can't get help | "No response from support in 3 days" |
| Process | Workflow is broken | "Need 5 approvals for simple change" |
| Learning | Hard to get started | "Took 2 weeks to set up" |

#### Step 4: Score Pain Points

**Pain Intensity Matrix:**

| Factor | Weight | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|--------|--------|---|---|---|
| Frequency | 30% | Rarely | Weekly | Daily |
| Severity | 25% | Annoying | Painful | Blocking |
| Reach | 20% | Few people | Many | Everyone |
| Spend | 15% | $0 spent | Some | Significant |
| Alternatives | 10% | Many exist | Few | None |

**Score = (Freq×0.3) + (Sev×0.25) + (Reach×0.2) + (Spend×0.15) + (Alt×0.1)**

**Priority:**
- Score > 4: Critical pain - high priority
- Score 3-4: Significant pain - worth solving
- Score 2-3: Moderate pain - could be feature
- Score < 2: Minor pain - deprioritize

#### Step 5: Extract Root Causes

For top pain points, dig deeper:

**5 Whys Analysis:**
```
Pain: "I spend 3 hours/week on expense reports"
Why 1: Reports are manual
Why 2: System doesn't auto-import receipts
Why 3: No OCR integration
Why 4: IT won't approve new tools
Why 5: Process for new tools takes 6 months
Root: Organizational friction in tool adoption
```

**Jobs to be Done:**
```
When [situation]
I want to [action]
So I can [outcome]
```

| Analytics confusing | Twitter rants | Complexity | 3.8 |

| Ignoring context | Note who is complaining |
| Confirmation bias | Document ALL pain points, not just expected |
| No categorization | Categorize to see patterns |
