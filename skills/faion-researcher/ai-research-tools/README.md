# AI Research Tools

## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Execute research queries | haiku | Mechanical tool invocation and parameter setup |
| Synthesize findings across tools | sonnet | Analysis and integration of multi-source data |
| Verify critical data points | opus | Complex validation and fact-checking decisions |
| Create research reports | sonnet | Analysis-driven synthesis and narrative building |
| Document research methodology | haiku | Pattern-based documentation of process |

## Problem

Manual research is slow and limited in scope.

## Solution: AI-Augmented Discovery

**AI Research Stack:**

| Stage | AI Tools |
|-------|----------|
| **Exploration** | Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude |
| **Deep Research** | Perplexity Pro Search, Claude Research Mode |
| **Competitor Analysis** | Crayon, Klue, Kompyte, Contify, AlphaSense |
| **User Sentiment** | Brandwatch, Sprout Social |
| **Market Data** | Statista AI, CB Insights |
| **Trend Analysis** | Exploding Topics, Google Trends |
| **Interview Analysis** | Looppanel, Dovetail, Insight7, UserBit |

**AI Research Workflow:**
```
1. Define research questions
2. AI-assisted broad exploration
3. Human curation of sources
4. AI synthesis of findings
5. Human analysis and insights
6. AI-generated report draft
7. Human review and finalization
```

**Best Practices:**
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use AI for speed and breadth | Trust AI output blindly |
| Verify AI findings with primary sources | Skip human analysis |
| Combine multiple AI tools | Rely on single source |
| Document AI sources used | Hide AI involvement |
| Use task-specific AI tools | Expect one tool to do everything |

**Stats:** 95% of researchers now use AI tools regularly (2025). 51% of UX researchers have embraced AI tools, 91% open to using them.

**Key Insight (2026):** The era of "the best AI assistant" as a single winner is over. The right assistant is the one matched to the task: a citation-first engine for research, a repo-aware copilot for code, and a multimodal generator for presentations.
