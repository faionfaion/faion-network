## Problem

Entrepreneurs either chase every trend (shiny object syndrome) or ignore trends completely (missing opportunities). Issues:
- Confusing noise with signal
- Entering trends too early or too late
- No framework for evaluating trend viability
- Following trends without personal fit

**The root cause:** No systematic approach to identifying and evaluating market trends.

**Best entry:** Just before mainstream adoption.

    Trend     High | Build     | OPTIMAL
    Strength       | Skills    | ENTRY
                   |-----------|----------
              Low  | Ignore    | Wait for
                   |           | clarity

**Timing considerations:**

| Stage | Opportunity | Risk |
|-------|-------------|------|
