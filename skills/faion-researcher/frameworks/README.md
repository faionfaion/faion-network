## 7 Ps of Ideation

Core framework for startup idea generation.

| P | Question | Example |
|---|----------|---------|
| **Pain** | What frustrates you daily? | Scheduling meetings across timezones |
| **Passion** | What do you love doing? | Teaching coding to kids |
| **Profession** | What's broken in your industry? | Medical billing complexity |
| **Process** | What workflow is inefficient? | Code review bottlenecks |
| **Platform** | What can be improved on existing platform? | Better Slack integrations |
| **People** | Who do you know with problems? | Freelancers need invoicing |
| **Product** | What product do you wish existed? | AI meeting summarizer |

### Usage
- Apply all 7 Ps systematically
- Generate 2-3 ideas per P
- Focus on problems you personally understand
- Look for intersection of multiple Ps

## Paul Graham's Questions

Proven patterns for finding startup ideas.

### Core Questions
1. **What's tedious but necessary?**
   - Look for manual, repetitive tasks
   - Example: Data entry, report generation

2. **What's surprisingly hard to do?**
   - Tasks that seem simple but aren't
   - Example: Scheduling across timezones

3. **What do you find yourself building for yourself?**
   - Tools you create to solve your problems
   - Example: Personal automation scripts

4. **What would you pay for that doesn't exist?**
   - Unmet needs with willingness to pay
   - Example: Better code review tools

### Application
- Answer each question honestly
- Look for patterns across answers
- Validate with 2-3 other people
- Check if solutions already exist

## Niche Evaluation Criteria

Multi-criteria scoring for idea viability.

| Criterion | 1-3 (Poor) | 4-6 (OK) | 7-10 (Excellent) |
|-----------|------------|----------|------------------|
| **Market size** | <$10M | $10M-100M | >$100M |
| **Competition** | Red ocean (saturated) | Moderate | Blue ocean (new) |
| **Barriers** | High (capital, regulatory) | Medium | Low (can start tomorrow) |
| **Profitability** | Thin margins (<10%) | Ok margins (10-30%) | High margins (>30%) |
| **Fit** | No relevant skills | Some skills | Perfect match |

### Scoring Interpretation
- **40-50 points:** Excellent opportunity, pursue immediately
- **30-39 points:** Good potential, worth testing
- **20-29 points:** Proceed with caution, consider pivots
- **<20 points:** Consider other ideas or major pivots

### How to Score
1. Score each criterion 1-10
2. Sum all scores (max 50)
3. Document reasoning for each score
4. Compare multiple ideas side-by-side

## Validation Criteria

Framework for validating problem-solution fit.

| Criterion | Threshold | How to Measure | Pass/Fail |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Frequency** | Weekly+ | "How often do you face this?" | Must be frequent |
| **Intensity** | 7+/10 | "How painful is this? (1-10)" | Must be painful |
| **WTP** | Yes | "Would you pay to solve this?" | Must have WTP |
| **Search** | Exists | Check Google Trends, keyword volume | People looking for solutions |
| **Competition** | Exists | Someone trying to solve it | Validates problem exists |

### Red Flags
- Low frequency (monthly or less)
- Low intensity (<5/10 pain)
- No willingness to pay
- No search volume
- No competitors (often means no market)

### Green Flags
- Daily/weekly frequency
- 8+/10 intensity
- Clear WTP ($X/month)
- Growing search volume
- Competitors exist but have gaps

## Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

Framework for understanding user motivations.

### Job Types

**Functional Jobs**
- What tasks are they trying to accomplish?
- Example: "Send invoice to client"

**Emotional Jobs**
- How do they want to feel?
- Example: "Feel professional and organized"

**Social Jobs**
- How do they want to be perceived?
- Example: "Be seen as reliable by clients"

### JTBD Statement Template
```
When [situation],
I want to [motivation],
So I can [expected outcome].
```

**Example:**
```
When I finish client work,
I want to quickly generate and send professional invoices,
So I can get paid faster and maintain my reputation.
```

### Application
1. Identify all 3 job types
2. Write JTBD statements
3. Prioritize by importance
4. Design solution to fulfill jobs

## TAM/SAM/SOM Framework

Market sizing methodology.

### Definitions

**TAM (Total Addressable Market)**
- Total market demand for a product/service
- "If we had 100% market share"
- Example: All businesses that need invoicing

**SAM (Serviceable Available Market)**
- Segment we can reach with our channels
- Geographic, regulatory, or technical constraints
- Example: SMBs in North America using cloud software

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**
- Realistic market share in 1-3 years
- Based on competition, resources, GTM
- Example: 5% of SAM in year 1

### Calculation Methods

**Top-Down:**
```
TAM = Total industry size (from reports)
SAM = TAM × % matching our criteria
SOM = SAM × realistic capture rate
```

**Bottom-Up:**
```
TAM = # potential customers × average revenue per customer
SAM = # reachable customers × ARPU
SOM = # customers we can acquire × ARPU
```

**Value Theory:**
```
TAM = Value created by solving problem
SAM = Value for specific segment
SOM = Value we can capture
```

## Competitive Intelligence Framework

Structured competitor analysis.

### Analysis Dimensions

| Dimension | Questions | Sources |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Features** | What do they offer? What's missing? | Product pages, demos, reviews |
| **Pricing** | How much? What tiers? | Pricing pages, sales calls |
| **Positioning** | Who do they target? What message? | Homepage, ads, case studies |
| **Technology** | What stack? What integrations? | Job postings, tech blogs |
| **Customer Feedback** | What do users love/hate? | Reviews, forums, support tickets |
| **GTM Strategy** | How do they acquire customers? | Traffic analysis, ads, content |

### Output Template
```
Competitor: [Name]
Founded: [Year]
Funding: [Amount, stage]

Strengths:
- [What they do well]

Weaknesses:
- [Gaps, complaints]

Opportunities:
- [What we can do better]

Threats:
- [What they might do]
```

## Value Proposition Canvas

Framework for product-market fit.

### Customer Profile (Right Side)

**Customer Jobs**
- Functional, emotional, social jobs

**Pains**
- Obstacles, risks, bad outcomes

**Gains**
- Desires, needs, success criteria

### Value Map (Left Side)

**Products & Services**
- What you offer

**Pain Relievers**
- How you eliminate pains

**Gain Creators**
- How you create gains

### Fit Assessment
- Do pain relievers address top pains?
- Do gain creators fulfill desired gains?
- Does offering help with important jobs?
