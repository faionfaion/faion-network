### Problem

Traditional waterfall development can't keep pace with market demands.

### Solution: Modern Development Methodology

**2026 Development Approach:**
```
Agile (Speed) + Data-Driven (Precision) + Cross-Functional (Breadth)
```

**Key Trends:**

| Trend | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| AI-augmented ideation | Pattern recognition at scale, gap identification |
| Continuous customer feedback | Real-time product iteration |
| Rapid pivots | Quarterly vs annual adjustment cycles |
| Cross-functional teams | PM + Design + Engineering collaboration |

**AI in Idea Generation:**
```
AI: Scans market trends, analyzes behavior, identifies gaps
        |
AI: Surfaces weak signals from user research
        |
Human: Decides which signals matter
        |
Together: Generate data-grounded product ideas
```

**Speed Requirements:**
- 2025+ turnaround expectation: Days, not weeks
- Insights must be actionable while still relevant
- Ability to pivot campaigns, refine prototypes in real-time

**Key Research Outputs:**
| Output | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Market Analysis Reports | Size, trends, competitive landscape |
| User Need Assessments | Pain points, unmet needs |
| Concept Validation Studies | Test ideas before building |
| Feature Priority Reports | What to build first |

**Consumer Trends (2025-2026):**
- Increasing demand for brands that "do good"
- Sustainable business practices
- Eco-friendly products
- Blending quantitative + qualitative in single platform
