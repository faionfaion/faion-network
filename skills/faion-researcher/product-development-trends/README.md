| Rapid pivots | Quarterly vs annual adjustment cycles |
| Cross-functional teams | PM + Design + Engineering collaboration |

**AI in Idea Generation:**
```
AI: Scans market trends, analyzes behavior, identifies gaps
        |
AI: Surfaces weak signals from user research
        |
Human: Decides which signals matter
        |
Together: Generate data-grounded product ideas
```

**Speed Requirements:**
- 2025+ turnaround expectation: Days, not weeks
- Insights must be actionable while still relevant
- Ability to pivot campaigns, refine prototypes in real-time

**Key Research Outputs:**
| Output | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Market Analysis Reports | Size, trends, competitive landscape |
| User Need Assessments | Pain points, unmet needs |
