## M-RES-022: Continuous Discovery

### Problem

Discovery treated as one-time project start activity.

### Solution: Ongoing Discovery Integration (Teresa Torres Framework)

**Continuous Discovery Habits:**

| Cadence | Activity | Output |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Daily | Review analytics, support tickets | Insight log |
| Weekly | User interviews (2-3) | Interview notes |
| Weekly | Competitor monitoring | Change log |
| Weekly | Assumption testing | Validated/invalidated assumptions |
| Bi-weekly | Synthesis session | Updated assumptions |
| Monthly | Research review | Research report |

**Teresa Torres 2025-2026 Updates:**
- Launched two new podcasts
- Built AI products for discovery workflows
- Integrated Claude Code into work processes
- Trained 18,000+ people in product discovery

**Product Trio Model:**
```
Product Manager + Designer + Engineer
        ↓
Weekly customer interviews (uncover opportunities)
        +
Weekly assumption testing (evaluate solutions)
        ↓
Avoid "curse of knowledge" bias
```

**Integration with Product:**
```
Discovery → Hypothesis → Experiment → Learn → Repeat
     ↑                                         |
     └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## M-RES-022A: Opportunity Solution Trees (OST)

### Problem

Teams lack structured framework for connecting outcomes to solutions.

### Solution: Visual Discovery Framework

**OST Components:**
```
Outcome (Business/Product Goal)
    │
    ├── Opportunity 1 (Customer Need/Pain Point)
    │       ├── Solution A
    │       │       └── Experiment 1
    │       │       └── Experiment 2
    │       └── Solution B
    │               └── Experiment 3
    │
    ├── Opportunity 2
    │       ├── Solution C
    │       └── Solution D
    │
    └── Opportunity 3
            └── Solution E
```

**OST Benefits:**
- Visualizes discovery thinking
- Aligns team around what to do
- Charts path to desired outcome
- Manages messy discovery cycles
- Creates shared understanding

**OST Best Practices:**
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Build collaboratively as team | Create in isolation |
| Update regularly | Treat as static document |
| Focus on opportunities before solutions | Jump to solutions first |
| Test assumptions with experiments | Build without validation |

**Tools:** Miro OST Template, FigJam, Whimsical

## M-RES-023: Problem Validation 2026

### Problem

Building products nobody needs.

### Solution: Evidence-Based Validation

**Validation Hierarchy:**
```
Strongest evidence:
├── 1. Users paid for solution (actual behavior)
├── 2. Users signed up/committed (commitment)
├── 3. Users engaged deeply with prototype (behavior)
├── 4. Users expressed strong interest (stated preference)
└── 5. Users said they have the problem (weakest)
```

**Mom Test Questions (2025 Updates):**
> Ask about their life, not your idea.

| Instead of | Ask |
|------------|-----|
| "Would you use this?" | "How do you currently solve X?" |
| "Is this a problem for you?" | "Tell me about the last time you dealt with X" |
| "Would you pay $X?" | "What have you tried? What did it cost?" |
| "Do you think this is a good idea?" | "When was the last time you faced this problem?" |

**Interview Opening Framework (2025):**
```
Vision → Framing → Weakness → Pedestal → Ask
1. State the problem you want to solve
2. Explain you have nothing to sell (just learning)
3. Humbly ask for their experience
4. Request some time
```

**Commitment Signals to Look For:**
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Time | Follow-up meeting, using prototype |
| Reputation | Introducing to boss/team |
| Money | Letter of intent, pre-order |

**Red Flags:**
- Compliments ("Great idea!")
- Hypotheticals ("I would definitely...")
- Generic statements ("Everyone needs this")
- Fishing for approval responses

**Key 2025 Principle:** Validating your startup idea isn't a one-time event—it's an ongoing process. The goal isn't to prove your idea is right; it's to find out if it's wrong as quickly and cheaply as possible.

## M-RES-024: AI-Assisted Persona Building

### Problem

Personas based on assumptions, not data.

### Solution: Data-Driven Personas

**AI-Enhanced Persona Process:**
```
1. Aggregate user data (analytics, interviews, surveys)
2. AI clustering of behavioral patterns
3. AI-generated persona drafts
4. Human validation and refinement
5. Ongoing persona updates from new data
```

**Modern Persona Components:**

| Section | Traditional | 2026 Addition |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Demographics | Age, location | Digital behavior |
| Goals | What they want | JTBD framework |
| Pain points | Frustrations | Quantified impact |
| Behavior | How they act | Trigger analysis |
| Quotes | Representative | Sentiment patterns |

**JTBD Integration:**
```
When [situation],
I want to [motivation],
So I can [expected outcome].
```

**Valid Use Cases:**
| Good For | Not Good For |
|----------|--------------|
| Early ideation | Go/no-go decisions |
| Hypothesis generation | Demand forecasting |
| Rapid concept testing | Final validation |
| Low-risk exploration | High-stakes decisions |
| When no research baseline exists | Replacing human research |

**Validation Framework:**
```
Synthetic Research → Real User Validation → Decision
       ↓                     ↓
   Directional          Confirmatory
   (Fast, cheap)        (Accurate, reliable)
```

**Key Limitations:**
- Cannot replace depth/empathy from real users
- Often provide shallow or favorable feedback
- Minor training changes produce different results
- No industry standards for quality testing
- Cannot understand nonverbal/behavioral cues

**Governance Best Practices:**
- Never use for go/no-go without human validation
- Define persona retirement schedule
- Assign ownership for persona accuracy
- Aim for "synthetic-organic parity" validation

**Market Insight:** Single greatest barrier to adoption is "crisis of trust" due to data quality, bias, and hallucination concerns. Emerging "Validation-as-a-Service" (VaaS) providers addressing this gap.
