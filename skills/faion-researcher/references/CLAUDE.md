## Key Frameworks

### Continuous Discovery (Teresa Torres)
```
Weekly customer interviews + Weekly assumption testing
    -> Avoid "curse of knowledge" bias
    -> Product Trio: PM + Designer + Engineer
```

### Opportunity Solution Trees
```
Outcome (Goal)
    -> Opportunity (Customer Need)
        -> Solution
            -> Experiment
```

### Validation Hierarchy (Strongest to Weakest)
1. Users paid for solution
2. Users signed up/committed
3. Users engaged with prototype
4. Users expressed strong interest
5. Users said they have the problem
