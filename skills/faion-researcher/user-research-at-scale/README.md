# User Research at Scale

## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Set up AI-powered research automation | sonnet | Medium-complexity automation design |
| Conduct unmoderated user testing | haiku | Mechanical test execution and recording |
| Analyze large-scale user data | opus | Complex pattern recognition across thousands |
| Create real-time sentiment dashboards | sonnet | Medium-complexity analysis and visualization |
| Generate cross-demographic insights | opus | Complex comparative analysis and strategic insights |

## Problem

Traditional research doesn't scale with product velocity.

## Solution: AI-Augmented Research Operations

**Scaling Research:**
| Team Size | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Small | Intuitive tools, built-in automation, AI analysis |
| Large | Scalability, collaboration, adaptable workflows |

**AI Capabilities for Scale:**
- Automate usability testing identification
- Test with thousands of users simultaneously
- Real-time sentiment tagging
- Cross-demographic analysis
- Pattern recognition at scale

**Platform Capabilities:**
| Platform | Key Features |

| Userlytics | Global panel (2M+), AI analytics |
| Maze | Bias detection, dynamic follow-ups |
| UserTesting | Scale unmoderated testing |
| dscout | Mobile ethnography at scale |

**AI as Co-Pilot Model:**
```
Human Researcher + AI Tools
        |
Human: Strategy, interpretation, empathy
AI: Data processing, pattern detection, speed
        |
Output: More research, faster, with human quality
```

**Research Market Growth:**
