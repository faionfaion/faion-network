# Client demo prep + run

**Persona:** P4 Outsource Specialist · **Tier:** pro · **Complexity:** medium · **Angle:** atomic

## Why this playbook exists

End-of-sprint demo to client stakeholders (often non-technical) → explicit acceptance per AC, action items captured, senior dev runs it solo (not the PM).

Atomic ceremony: end-of-sprint demo with the offshore senior leading. Output: per-AC explicit acceptance, captured action items, recording archived, narrative tailored to executive audience where present. Avoids 'great, send a recording' non-decisions.

Most outsource seniors improvise this flow — fine at one engagement, costly across five. This playbook fixes the chain: explicit stages, explicit decision-gates, written artifacts at every step, AI agents on a leash, no silent work absorption.

Sprint demos to client stakeholders are the moment your team's two weeks earns the right to two more. An offshore senior runs the demo because the PM was not in the code; the dev who built it tells the story better than anyone. The demo is a sales artefact — sold to the same buyer every sprint.

## How to run it

Walk the stages in order. Each stage has a decision-gate; do not advance until the gate condition is met in writing. A stranger should be able to read the artifacts and understand both *what* you did and *why* you advanced. Atomic stages are designed to be completed in a single sitting; deep stages span multiple sessions.

## Stage map

### Stage 1 — Prep narrative

**Intent:** Build the story arc before opening the IDE.

**Tasks**
- Identify primary stakeholder + their question
- Stakeholder-engagement pass for executive comms
- Storytelling frame: problem → choice → outcome
- Selling-ideas patterns for non-tech audience

**Outputs**
- Demo narrative draft (3-5 beats)
- Stakeholder note

**Decision gate**

Advance only when narrative answers the primary stakeholder's question.

Prep starts with the audience question, not the feature list. Who is in the room? What do they want to know? Build a narrative that answers their question first; the AC walkthrough comes after. Storytelling discipline is what separates a demo from a feature walkthrough.

### Stage 2 — Script + dry-run

**Intent:** Make sure the demo runs the same in front of the client as in rehearsal.

**Tasks**
- Write demo script tied to AC
- Dry-run end-to-end with team
- Verify environment + data look real, not synthetic
- Prepare fallback for any flaky path
- Scrum-ceremonies discipline on time-box

**Outputs**
- Demo script
- Dry-run notes

**Decision gate**

Advance only after a clean dry-run.

Script + dry-run feels like overhead until your environment crashes mid-demo. Dry-run once with the team; surface the flaky paths; prepare fallbacks. The script keeps you inside the time-box even when the room takes the conversation sideways.

### Stage 3 — Run + collect acceptance

**Intent:** Drive the demo, surface acceptance per AC, capture actions.

**Tasks**
- Run demo; call out AC explicitly per ticket
- Use requirements-validation prompts to lock acceptance
- Capture action items with named owners + dates
- Record the session and archive

**Outputs**
- AC checkmarks per ticket
- Action item list
- Recording archived

**Decision gate**

Done only when acceptance per AC is explicit. 'Looks good' without per-AC sign is incomplete.

Running the demo well means closing each AC live. 'Looks good, send the recording' is a non-decision. Drive to explicit acceptance per ticket. Capture action items with named owners and dates before the call ends. Send a recap inside 30 minutes.

## Common pitfalls

- Showing features without tying them to the AC
- Letting acceptance default to 'send the recording'
- Demo-driven development — building flashy things instead of valid ones

## Quality checklist

- Did the primary stakeholder get an answer to their question?
- Did I close every AC live?
- Did I leave with named action owners and dates?

## Closing note

Demos compound: each clean acceptance protects the engagement's right to the next sprint. Pair with the weekly status report for tracking RAG and with the JIRA scoping playbook to make sure the demo has clean tickets to show.

## Gaps

These methodologies are referenced in the chain above but not yet materialised. They block promotion of this playbook from `draft` to `published`.

- `executive-stakeholder-demo-narrative-frame` (blocks stage 1)
- `sprint-demo-script-template` (blocks stage 2)
