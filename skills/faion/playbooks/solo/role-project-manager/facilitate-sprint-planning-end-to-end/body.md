# Facilitate sprint planning end-to-end

## Context

A 1-hour ceremony at sprint start: confirm the goal, pull capacity-fit work, leave with a committed backlog, owner per item, and a sprint goal everyone can repeat.

Tier: **solo**. Complexity: **medium**. Group: **role-project-manager**. Persona: **role-project-manager**.

## Outcome

This playbook is done when:

- Sprint goal is a one-line outcome tied to roadmap.
- Capacity calc has documented deductions.
- Every pulled item has an owner.
- 100% of contributors can restate the goal.
- Sprint plan broadcast within 30 minutes.

## Steps

### 1. Lock the goal

Sprint goal in one sentence.

Tasks:
- Draft the sprint goal as a single sentence the team can repeat.
- Tie the goal to a roadmap outcome.
- Confirm with PM + tech lead.

Outputs:
- Sprint goal one-liner.

Decision gate: Advance when the goal is one sentence and tied to an outcome.

### 2. Capacity check

Lock realistic capacity for this sprint.

Tasks:
- Pull team capacity adjusted for PTO + meetings.
- Subtract sustained ops load.
- Lock the working capacity number.

Outputs:
- Capacity calc.

Decision gate: Advance when capacity has explicit deductions documented.

### 3. Pull-fit work

Pull from the ready queue against capacity.

Tasks:
- Walk the top of the AC-ready queue.
- Pull items until capacity is reached.
- Stop pulling when uncertainty rises above threshold.

Outputs:
- Pulled sprint backlog.

Decision gate: Advance when pulled backlog fits capacity with a small buffer.

### 4. Owners + dependencies

Lock who does what + what blocks what.

Tasks:
- Assign an owner per item.
- Confirm any cross-team dependencies are already commited by the other side.
- Flag any unassigned items as 'team-pool'.

Outputs:
- Owner + dependency annotations.

Decision gate: Advance when every pulled item has an owner.

### 5. Repeat-back ritual

Confirm the team can repeat the sprint goal.

Tasks:
- Ask each contributor to restate the sprint goal in their own words.
- Capture any divergence as a misalignment risk.
- Adjust the goal language if 2+ people diverge.

Outputs:
- Goal-repeat-back log.

Decision gate: Advance when 100% of contributors can restate the goal.

### 6. Broadcast + log

Publish the sprint plan.

Tasks:
- Post the sprint goal + pulled backlog to the team channel.
- File the plan in the canonical location.
- Update stakeholders on the sprint goal.

Outputs:
- Sprint plan broadcast.

Decision gate: Required: broadcast sent within 30 minutes of planning end.

## Decision points

- Pull until capacity vs pull until uncertainty — stop at uncertainty if 2+ items are unknown-shaped.
- Strict scope vs flex scope — strict when the goal is a single outcome; flex when the sprint is operational maintenance.
