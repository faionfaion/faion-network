# Scope-change conversation when client says 'just one more thing'

## Context

This playbook covers the atomic flow for the persona `p3-technical-freelancer`. It applies whenever the trigger described in the scope below appears in the operator's workflow. The output is a written, auditable artefact pack, not a verbal hand-wave.

## Outcome

Inbound request outside agreed scope. Done = either a written change order with new price/timeline, or a polite deferral to next sprint, with no silent absorption.

## Steps

### 1. Scope

Define the scope, exit criteria, and the people who must agree on success.

Tasks:
- Restate the scope outcome for this engagement in one sentence.
- Identify who owns the scope output and who must approve it.
- Produce the scope artefact in the agreed format.

Methodologies:
- `pro/ba/business-analyst/requirements-validation`
- `solo/comms/communicator/negotiation`

Decision gate: Advance to the next stage when the scope artefact is approved by the named owner; iterate if any blocker remains.

### 2. Discovery

Gather evidence about the current state, stakeholders, constraints, and prior data.

Tasks:
- Restate the discovery outcome for this engagement in one sentence.
- Identify who owns the discovery output and who must approve it.
- Produce the discovery artefact in the agreed format.

Methodologies:
- `pro/pm/project-manager/change-control`

Decision gate: Advance to the next stage when the discovery artefact is approved by the named owner; iterate if any blocker remains.

### 3. Plan

Turn discovery output into a written plan with owners, sequence, and risk reserves.

Tasks:
- Restate the plan outcome for this engagement in one sentence.
- Identify who owns the plan output and who must approve it.
- Produce the plan artefact in the agreed format.

Methodologies:
- `pro/pm/project-manager/communications-management`

Decision gate: Advance to the next stage when the plan artefact is approved by the named owner; iterate if any blocker remains.

### 4. Execute

Run the plan in order of dependency; ship each output before moving on.

Tasks:
- Restate the execute outcome for this engagement in one sentence.
- Identify who owns the execute output and who must approve it.
- Produce the execute artefact in the agreed format.

Methodologies:
- `pro/pm/project-manager/scope-management`

Decision gate: Advance to the next stage when the execute artefact is approved by the named owner; iterate if any blocker remains.

### 5. Verify

Check the work against the exit criteria with the people who signed off in Scope.

Tasks:
- Restate the verify outcome for this engagement in one sentence.
- Identify who owns the verify output and who must approve it.
- Produce the verify artefact in the agreed format.

Methodologies:
- `solo/comms/communicator/difficult-conversations`

Decision gate: Advance to the next stage when the verify artefact is approved by the named owner; iterate if any blocker remains.

## Decision points

- Each stage has a written decision gate; do not advance unless the gate's owner has signed off in the artefact log.
- If a stage gate fails twice, escalate to the playbook's named maintainer before retrying.
