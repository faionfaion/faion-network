# Microservice extraction safety gate

**Slug:** `microservice-extraction-safety-gate` · **Tier:** pro · **Complexity:** medium

## Context

Decide whether to extract a service from a modular monolith, with reversibility + bulkhead criteria, BEFORE writing the extraction PR

## Outcome

The playbook is done when each stage below has produced its artifact, the decision gate has been passed in writing, and the operator can show a teammate a clean evidence trail across the entire chain.

## Steps

### Step 1: Prepare

Achieve the 'prepare' outcome by working through the tasks listed in `playbook.yaml`. Capture the named outputs and resolve open questions before moving on.

### Step 2: Inventory

Achieve the 'inventory' outcome by working through the tasks listed in `playbook.yaml`. Capture the named outputs and resolve open questions before moving on.

### Step 3: Decide approach

Achieve the 'decide approach' outcome by working through the tasks listed in `playbook.yaml`. Capture the named outputs and resolve open questions before moving on.

### Step 4: Execute

Achieve the 'execute' outcome by working through the tasks listed in `playbook.yaml`. Capture the named outputs and resolve open questions before moving on.

### Step 5: Verify

Achieve the 'verify' outcome by working through the tasks listed in `playbook.yaml`. Capture the named outputs and resolve open questions before moving on.

### Step 6: Document & decide

Achieve the 'document & decide' outcome by working through the tasks listed in `playbook.yaml`. Capture the named outputs and resolve open questions before moving on.

## Decision points

Each stage in `playbook.yaml` carries an explicit `decision_gate`. Treat them as hard exits — do not advance on vibes. The two highest-stakes gates in this playbook:

- **Entry gate** — confirm prerequisites are real, not assumed. If a prerequisite is missing, stop and resolve it before starting Step 1.
- **Final gate** — the playbook closes with a written decision artifact. No 'see how it goes'.
