# Stakeholder-conflict facilitation and decision rationale capture

**Persona:** role-ba - **Tier:** pro - **Complexity:** medium - **Angle:** synthesis

## Context

Mid-engagement: two stakeholder groups disagree on scope. BA facilitates, captures positions, runs structured decision, records rationale for audit. Output: decision record + updated baseline + impact assessment.

Most operators improvise this flow. That works at low volume and breaks at scale. This playbook fixes the chain: explicit stages, explicit decision-gates, written artifacts at every step.

## Outcome

By the final stage, the operator holds a written artifact for every step, every decision-gate passed in writing, and a documented go / no-go (or kill) trail another person can audit without asking a question.

## Steps

### 1. Frame

*Intent:* State the outcome, constraints, and exit-condition in one paragraph.

Tasks:
- Read the assigned methodology references and reconcile them with this stage's goal.
- Produce the stage artifact named in 'outputs' and store it where the next stage can read it.
- Re-check the decision gate before advancing; loop within this stage if it fails.

Methodologies in scope:
- `change-request-impact-rubric`

Outputs:
- Written artifact for stage 1 (Frame) named per the project's docs convention
- Decision-gate note (advance / iterate / kill) appended to the playbook log

*Decision gate:* Advance when the stage 1 artifact exists in writing AND the methodology chain assigned to this stage has been applied. Iterate or escalate otherwise.

### 2. Discover

*Intent:* Pull evidence and prior art before any design decision.

Tasks:
- Read the assigned methodology references and reconcile them with this stage's goal.
- Produce the stage artifact named in 'outputs' and store it where the next stage can read it.
- Re-check the decision gate before advancing; loop within this stage if it fails.

Methodologies in scope:
- `pro/ba/ba-core/ba-requirements-mgmt`

Outputs:
- Written artifact for stage 2 (Discover) named per the project's docs convention
- Decision-gate note (advance / iterate / kill) appended to the playbook log

*Decision gate:* Advance when the stage 2 artifact exists in writing AND the methodology chain assigned to this stage has been applied. Iterate or escalate otherwise.

### 3. Design

*Intent:* Sketch target structure with explicit cuts and trade-offs.

Tasks:
- Read the assigned methodology references and reconcile them with this stage's goal.
- Produce the stage artifact named in 'outputs' and store it where the next stage can read it.
- Re-check the decision gate before advancing; loop within this stage if it fails.

Methodologies in scope:
- `pro/ba/ba-core/requirements-traceability`

Outputs:
- Written artifact for stage 3 (Design) named per the project's docs convention
- Decision-gate note (advance / iterate / kill) appended to the playbook log

*Decision gate:* Advance when the stage 3 artifact exists in writing AND the methodology chain assigned to this stage has been applied. Iterate or escalate otherwise.

### 4. Build

*Intent:* Implement the smallest version that proves the chain works.

Tasks:
- Read the assigned methodology references and reconcile them with this stage's goal.
- Produce the stage artifact named in 'outputs' and store it where the next stage can read it.
- Re-check the decision gate before advancing; loop within this stage if it fails.

Methodologies in scope:
- `pro/ba/ba-core/stakeholder-analysis`

Outputs:
- Written artifact for stage 4 (Build) named per the project's docs convention
- Decision-gate note (advance / iterate / kill) appended to the playbook log

*Decision gate:* Advance when the stage 4 artifact exists in writing AND the methodology chain assigned to this stage has been applied. Iterate or escalate otherwise.

### 5. Validate

*Intent:* Test against the rubric or real data before broad rollout.

Tasks:
- Read the assigned methodology references and reconcile them with this stage's goal.
- Produce the stage artifact named in 'outputs' and store it where the next stage can read it.
- Re-check the decision gate before advancing; loop within this stage if it fails.

Methodologies in scope:
- `pro/ba/ba-modeling/decision-analysis`

Outputs:
- Written artifact for stage 5 (Validate) named per the project's docs convention
- Decision-gate note (advance / iterate / kill) appended to the playbook log

*Decision gate:* Advance when the stage 5 artifact exists in writing AND the methodology chain assigned to this stage has been applied. Iterate or escalate otherwise.

### 6. Close

*Intent:* Apply decision gate, document outcome, archive for re-use.

Tasks:
- Read the assigned methodology references and reconcile them with this stage's goal.
- Produce the stage artifact named in 'outputs' and store it where the next stage can read it.
- Re-check the decision gate before advancing; loop within this stage if it fails.

Methodologies in scope:
- `stakeholder-conflict-facilitation-script`

Outputs:
- Written artifact for stage 6 (Close) named per the project's docs convention
- Decision-gate note (advance / iterate / kill) appended to the playbook log

*Decision gate:* Advance when the stage 6 artifact exists in writing AND the methodology chain assigned to this stage has been applied. Iterate or escalate otherwise.

## Decision points

Each stage carries a decision-gate. Do not advance until the gate condition is met in writing. If a gate fails twice in a row, escalate to the playbook's review owner rather than looping a third time.
