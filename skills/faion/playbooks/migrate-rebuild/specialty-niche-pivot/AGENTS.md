# Specialty niche pivot (8-12 weeks generalist to specialist)

**Persona:** P3 Technical Freelancer · **Tier:** pro · **Complexity:** deep · **Angle:** global

## Why this playbook exists

Move from generic 'full-stack dev' to a paid specialist position (e.g. headless-commerce on Shopify Hydrogen, or AI integrations for SMB SaaS) with 2 case studies, a tightened portfolio, and a 30-50% higher day rate.

Most technical freelancers improvise this flow. That works at low volume and breaks at scale. This playbook fixes the chain: explicit stages, explicit decision-gates, written artifacts at every step, no silent absorption of work, no vague pricing.

## How to run it

Run the stages in order. Each stage has a decision-gate; do not advance until the gate condition is met in writing. A stranger should be able to read the artifacts and understand both *what* you did and *why* you advanced.

## Stage map

### Stage 1 — Audit & pick niche

**Intent:** Survey past work + market signals; pick one niche with paid demand.

**Tasks**
- List 5-7 candidate niches you have past relevant work in
- Score on demand signal + competition + your appetite
- Pick one and commit for 12 weeks

**Outputs**
- Niche shortlist with scores
- Commitment doc

**Decision gate**

Advance with a single chosen niche, written commitment, and no parallel niches.

### Stage 2 — Re-position + craft proof

**Intent:** Re-brand portfolio + LinkedIn around the niche.

**Tasks**
- Rewrite portfolio headline + first-fold copy
- Update LinkedIn headline + featured section
- Ship 2 case studies from past work in this niche

**Outputs**
- Updated portfolio site
- Updated LinkedIn
- 2 case studies

**Decision gate**

Advance when niche is mentioned in every public surface. Audit weekly.

### Stage 3 — Deepen technical authority

**Intent:** Become discoverable as the specialist via durable content.

**Tasks**
- Publish 1 technical deep-dive per week for 8 weeks
- Run 1 podcast / guest post / talk per month
- Build a small open-source artifact in the niche

**Outputs**
- 8 technical posts
- 1+ podcast appearance
- Open-source artifact

**Decision gate**

Advance when first inbound lead arrives mentioning the content. Otherwise iterate distribution.

### Stage 4 — Raise the rate

**Intent:** Move day rate +30-50% on new and existing engagements.

**Tasks**
- Set new rate floor
- Quote new prospects at new rate; track close rate
- Send rate-rise notices to top-half existing clients

**Outputs**
- New rate quotes
- Rate-rise sent log
- Updated pipeline economics

**Decision gate**

Advance if ≥50% close-rate holds at new rate over 4 new quotes. Otherwise refine offer, not rate.

## Common pitfalls

- Treating decision_gate as a suggestion — playbook collapses to a checklist if gates are not enforced
- Skipping written artifacts because 'it's in my head' — kills traceability and future re-use

## Quality self-review

- Did every stage produce a written artifact a stranger could read?
- Did I actually advance only when the decision_gate criterion was met?

## Gaps in the methodology chain

This playbook is **draft** because the methodology chain references slugs that are not yet authored:

- `niche-scorecard` (stage 1) — Stage 1 (Audit & pick niche) references this; no methodology exists yet.
- `buyer-interview-script-for-freelancers` (stage 1) — Stage 1 (Audit & pick niche) references this; no methodology exists yet.
- `case-study-clause-template` (stage 2) — Stage 2 (Re-position + craft proof) references this; no methodology exists yet.
- `freelance-rate-jump-tactics` (stage 4) — Stage 4 (Raise the rate) references this; no methodology exists yet.
- `growth-linkedin-strategy` (stage 2) — Stage 2 (Re-position + craft proof) cites pro/marketing/smm-manager/growth-linkedin-strategy but path does not resolve under KNOWLEDGE_ROOT.
- `business-storytelling` (stage 2) — Stage 2 (Re-position + craft proof) cites solo/marketing/content-marketer/business-storytelling but path does not resolve under KNOWLEDGE_ROOT.
- `best-practices-2026` (stage 3) — Stage 3 (Deepen technical authority) cites solo/dev/software-developer/best-practices-2026 but path does not resolve under KNOWLEDGE_ROOT.
- `dev-methodologies-architecture` (stage 3) — Stage 3 (Deepen technical authority) cites solo/dev/software-developer/dev-methodologies-architecture but path does not resolve under KNOWLEDGE_ROOT.

BLOCK policy: this playbook cannot move to `published` until `gaps[]` is empty.

## How this connects to the wider Faion catalog

The methodology chain links into `solo/comms/communicator`, `solo/marketing/*`, `pro/ba/business-analyst`, `pro/pm/project-manager`, `pro/marketing/*`, `pro/product/*`. Run `faion get-content <slug> --format context` to pull the full set into an agent-readable payload.

## When to use this playbook

This is a deep-complexity global-angle playbook for the P3 Technical Freelancer persona — solo contractors who deliver client work for revenue, run a small portfolio of accounts, and need repeatable rituals more than novel theory. Use it when the situation matches the *Why this playbook exists* statement. Do not use it for full-time-employee workflows or large-team delivery — those have different decision gates.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Running the stages out of order because one feels more urgent. Order encodes risk: skipping earlier stages usually means absorbing risk in a later stage where the cost is higher.
- Treating outputs as optional. Every stage requires a written artifact — that artifact is what makes the next decision-gate verifiable.
- Letting the client write your scope, your timeline, or your contract clauses. The whole point of this playbook is that *you* run a deterministic pipeline; the client engages with the pipeline, not the other way around.
- Skipping the closure / retro step. The compounding value of running this playbook many times is in the lessons captured at the end. Without retros, you re-learn the same expensive lessons every quarter.

## Agent prompt hints

If you are routing this playbook through `faion get-content` for an agent:

- Ask the agent to produce *each* stage's outputs as named files before moving to the next stage. Reject hand-wave outputs.
- Have the agent state the decision-gate condition out loud after producing outputs, and pass the gate before continuing.
- For any gap in the methodology chain (see *Gaps in the methodology chain* above), the agent should explicitly mark its substitute approach so you can backfill the missing methodology later.
