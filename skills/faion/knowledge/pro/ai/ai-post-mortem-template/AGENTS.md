# AI Post-Mortem Template

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Post-mortem report template for incidents in AI features (hallucination, refusal, drift, eval miss) — root cause, contributing factors, action items keyed to AI-specific failure modes.

**One-paragraph:** Post-mortem report template for incidents in AI features (hallucination, refusal, drift, eval miss) — root cause, contributing factors, action items keyed to AI-specific failure modes. This methodology codifies the rules, output contract, failure modes, and decision tree needed for a report produced by an agent applying ai post-mortem template. The deliverable is validated against an explicit JSON Schema and routed through a decision tree that maps observable signals to rule ids in `01-core-rules.xml`.

**Ефективно для:**

- Building a reproducible report for ai post-mortem template across teams.
- Reviewing AI-or-human work against an explicit contract instead of vibes.
- Wiring the output into downstream automation (CI gates, observability, post-mortems).
- Avoiding the failure modes listed in `03-failure-modes.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- an AI feature incident has occurred (user-visible regression, hallucination cluster, drift detection, eval miss)
- the org runs blameless post-mortems and expects this incident to feed corrective actions
- the incident involves at least one LLM call in the failure path

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- incident has no AI component (pure infra outage) — use ordinary infra post-mortem template
- incident is a single-user complaint with no signal of systemic issue — use ticket triage instead
- team does not own the affected AI feature — escalate to the owning team

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Incident timeline | tool / ticket / chat exports | incident commander |
| Affected prompt + model version | git SHA + model ID | ml-engineering |
| Eval suite history | scores + changes around incident date | ml-engineering |
| User-impact data | sessions affected + severity | product analytics |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals from inputs and intermediate artefacts to a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`, telling the agent which variant of the methodology to apply or when to stop. Walk it on every fresh invocation; do not memo-ise outcomes across distinct engagements.
