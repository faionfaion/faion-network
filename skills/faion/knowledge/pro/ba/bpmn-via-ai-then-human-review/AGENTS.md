# BPMN via AI then Human Review

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Two-pass BPMN authoring: LLM drafts BPMN 2.0 XML from process transcript, named SME reviews + signs + commits — never AI-only commit.

**One-paragraph:** Two-pass BPMN authoring: LLM drafts BPMN 2.0 XML from process transcript, named SME reviews + signs + commits — never AI-only commit. The artefact is captured as a versioned record (JSON or Markdown) downstream agents and reviewers consume without re-deriving rationale. Mechanism: typed input → bounded transformation → contract-checked output.

**Ефективно для:**

- Regulated-domain process modelling (FinTech KYC, AML, healthcare).
- Acceleration BA process drafting з мандатним human-gate.
- Audit-grade BPMN з sign-off trail.
- Migration / replatform — bulk current-state drafting.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Process modelling required in regulated context.
- SME reachable for review within 5 working days of draft.
- BPMN XML must validate against schema.
- Audit trail (sign-off + diff) is required.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Greenfield product with no current process.
- Non-regulated workflow where review overhead exceeds value.
- SME unavailable / disengaged.
