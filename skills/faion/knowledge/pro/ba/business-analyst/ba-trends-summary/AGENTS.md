# BA Trends Routing Index

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Read-only routing index of 2025-2026 BA trends (AI-enabled decisions, outcome-driven strategy, responsible innovation, operational resilience, digital trust, sustainability) mapped to internal methodology.

**One-paragraph:** Read-only routing index of 2025-2026 BA trends (AI-enabled decisions, outcome-driven strategy, responsible innovation, operational resilience, digital trust, sustainability) mapped to internal methodology. Captured as a versioned artefact downstream agents and reviewers consume without re-deriving rationale. Mechanism: typed input → bounded transformation → contract-checked output.

**Ефективно для:**

- Orientation для new senior BA: which trend → which methodology.
- Quarterly trend review session.
- Pre-engagement scoping — який trend dominates context.
- Sales / pre-sales positioning conversation.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- BA org wants alignment between external trends and internal methodology library.
- Trends inventory exists (≤8 trends for review period).
- Each trend can be mapped to internal methodology or 'no current coverage'.
- Report consumed by BA lead + sponsor.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Tactical engagement with no strategic review.
- Trend list outdated by &gt;12 months — refresh first.
- Org without methodology library to route to.
