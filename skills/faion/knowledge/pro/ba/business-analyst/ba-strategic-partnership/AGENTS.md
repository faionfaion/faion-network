# BA Strategic Partnership

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Evolution checklist that lifts a BA from documentation-only execution to strategic-partner stance — quarterly OKR co-ownership, business-case authorship, named sponsor mapping.

**One-paragraph:** Evolution checklist that lifts a BA from documentation-only execution to strategic-partner stance — quarterly OKR co-ownership, business-case authorship, named sponsor mapping. Captured as a versioned artefact downstream agents and reviewers consume without re-deriving rationale. Mechanism: typed input → bounded transformation → contract-checked output.

**Ефективно для:**

- Senior BA / lead BA repositioning to strategic partner role.
- Quarterly OKR alignment sessions з sponsor + delivery.
- Career-growth artefact для performance review.
- Outsource P4 engagement positioning против commodity BA work.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- BA has ≥6 months tenure with current sponsor.
- Sponsor named and reachable for quarterly sync.
- Existing BA work consistent (no firefighting baseline).
- Org has OKR / strategic-plan structure to align against.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- First-month BA on new engagement — execute basics first.
- Sponsor not engaged or transition imminent.
- Tactical engagement (≤8 weeks) where strategic stance is overreach.
