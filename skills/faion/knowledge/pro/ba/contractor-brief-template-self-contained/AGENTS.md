# Contractor Brief Template (Self-Contained)

## Summary

**One-sentence:** A self-contained contractor brief carrying all context, deliverable spec, AC, evidence checkpoints, and payment terms a subcontractor needs to execute without follow-up questions.

**One-paragraph:** Subcontractor briefs that link out to '6 wikis and a Notion doc' fail: the contractor doesn't have access, the doc rots, the deliverable misses scope. Self-contained briefs inline every piece of context (background, deliverable shape, AC, evidence checkpoints, rate + payment terms, escalation owner). Output: a single Markdown artefact the contractor signs off and the founder pays against.

**Ефективно для:**

- Solo-founder / micro-agency engagements with external contractors.
- Short-cycle (1–4 week) deliverables with fixed price.
- Engagements where the contractor has no access to internal systems.
- Re-engagements after a previous failed contractor cycle.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- the deliverable shape is well-defined enough to write AC
- named escalation owner exists (the founder or a delegate)
- rate + payment terms are agreed
- engagement length ≤ 4 weeks (longer engagements need an ongoing collaboration spec)

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- the deliverable is exploratory / discovery — switch to a discovery sprint brief
- internal-employee work — use the standard story template
- rate or scope not yet agreed — finalise before drafting the brief

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| deliverable description | MD / ticket | founder / BA |
| AC drafted | MD | founder / BA |
| rate + payment terms | contract | founder / legal |
| named escalation owner | org chart | founder |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input completeness, ownership clarity, regulatory context, scope size) to a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about whether to run, skip, or split this methodology.
