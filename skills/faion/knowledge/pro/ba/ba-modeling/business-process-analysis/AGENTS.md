# Business Process Analysis

## Summary

**One-sentence:** 5-stage cycle (identify → document → analyze → future-state → validate) that turns raw process evidence into BPMN + a value/time/cost analysis report.

**One-paragraph:** Pre-automation discovery for cross-team workflows: identify candidate processes, document current state with source citations, run a value/time/cost analysis, design a future state expressed as a diff table (not prose), and validate with stakeholders. Output artefacts: `process-documentation.md`, `process-analysis.md`, BPMN XML, and a future-state diff. The report becomes the input contract for the downstream automation team (n8n, RPA, backend service).

**Ефективно для:**

- Pre-automation discovery перед написанням n8n / RPA / backend сервісу.
- Cross-team workflows із symptoms of waste (rework, dual entry, long queues).
- Compliance / audit prep — документований process map з controls.
- Pre-spec stage BA-heavy SDD feature; output → requirements + AC.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Raw process evidence exists (SOPs, Slack threads, ticket histories, transcripts).
- A cross-team workflow shows symptoms of waste (rework loops, long queues, dual entry).
- Pre-automation discovery is required before writing an n8n/RPA/backend service.
- Stakeholders for each lane can be named and reached for validation.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Greenfield product where no current process exists — use use-case-modeling or user-story-mapping.
- One-off troubleshooting of a single broken instance — use 5-whys / fishbone.
- Tactical UI tweaks where the "process" is one click.
- Highly creative / knowledge-work flows (R&D, design) where steps are non-deterministic.
- Team is already mid-redesign and stakeholders have agreed on future state.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree routes on observable signals (evidence completeness, stakeholder availability, automation downstream Yes/No) to the right step of the cycle and the matching rule. Use when in doubt whether the analysis is ready to advance to future-state design.
