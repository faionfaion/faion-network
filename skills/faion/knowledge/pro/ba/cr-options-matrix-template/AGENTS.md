# CR Options Matrix Template

## Summary

**One-sentence:** An options matrix for major Change Requests scoring ≥2 viable responses on cost / value / risk and routing the recommended option to the named approver.

**One-paragraph:** Major CRs need option comparison, not just an impact memo. This template forces ≥2 viable response options (accept-as-is / reduce-scope / defer / re-baseline), scores each on cost / value / risk, names the recommendation, and routes it via `change-request-impact-rubric`. Output: a Markdown options matrix attached to the CR record.

**Ефективно для:**

- Major CRs (bin L per change-request-impact-rubric).
- Re-baselining decisions on multi-quarter programs.
- Steering-committee submissions where option theatre is forbidden.
- Programs with a track record of single-option recommendations failing.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- the CR is bin L (major) per change-request-impact-rubric
- the program has capacity to enumerate ≥2 viable options
- named approver exists
- scoring rubric for cost / value / risk is agreed

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- CR is bin S or M — use cr-impact-memo-template instead
- single-option forced (regulatory mandate) — escalate as no-option memo
- no scoring rubric — agree one first

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input completeness, ownership clarity, regulatory context, scope size) to a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about whether to run, skip, or split this methodology.
