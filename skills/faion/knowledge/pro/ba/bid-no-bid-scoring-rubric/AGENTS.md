# Bid / No-Bid Scoring Rubric

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Pre-bid 0-100 weighted rubric across 6 dimensions (fit / margin / risk / timeline / team / strategic) with go/no-go threshold and named approver.

**One-paragraph:** Pre-bid 0-100 weighted rubric across 6 dimensions (fit / margin / risk / timeline / team / strategic) with go/no-go threshold and named approver. The artefact is captured as a versioned record (JSON or Markdown) downstream agents and reviewers consume without re-deriving rationale. Mechanism: typed input → bounded transformation → contract-checked output.

**Ефективно для:**

- Pre-bid discovery for fixed-price engagement (P4).
- Pipeline triage коли inbound RFPs &gt; capacity.
- Cross-team alignment перед commitment.
- Audit trail для quarterly win/loss review.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- RFP / opportunity is fixed-price or substantial scope.
- Decision involves multiple stakeholders (sales / delivery / finance).
- Bid effort itself costs more than $5k.
- Win/loss can be tracked downstream.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Tiny opportunity (under $5k, low bid effort).
- Existing-client expansion already committed.
- Pure-T&M staffing where rubric overhead exceeds bid effort.
