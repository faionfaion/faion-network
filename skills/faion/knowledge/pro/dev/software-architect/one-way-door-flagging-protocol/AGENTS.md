# One-Way-Door Flagging Protocol

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Decision-time protocol that tags every architecture decision as one-way-door or two-way-door at the ADR header, routes one-way doors through a heavier review path (48h cooldown + devil's-advocate reviewer + rollback estimate), and reviews misclassifications quarterly for calibration.

**One-paragraph:** Decision-time protocol that tags every architecture decision as one-way-door or two-way-door at the ADR header, routes one-way doors through a heavier review path (48h cooldown + devil's-advocate reviewer + rollback estimate), and reviews misclassifications quarterly for calibration. The methodology pins the discipline that turns folklore into a reviewable, owned, version-controlled operating artefact: rule-bound output contract, evidence anchors, named owner, published review cadence. Outputs of the wrong shape are rejected at review; outputs without evidence are demoted to hypotheses; outputs without owners are tagged stale.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- A team is producing decision-record for the topic 'One-Way-Door Flagging Protocol'.
- Output is reviewed by a named human on a published cadence.
- Inputs and constraints fit the rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- One-shot work with no recurrence — write a single doc, not a versioned artefact.
- Regulated context that mandates a different template — use the regulator's.
- No named owner is available — defer until ownership is resolved.

**Ефективно для:**

- Teams using ADRs that want explicit reversibility tagging at decision time.
- Routing irreversible decisions through a heavier review (cooldown + devil's-advocate + rollback).
- Calibrating misclassification rate quarterly across an ADR corpus.
- Engineering leaders enforcing decision hygiene after an architecture regret.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Versioned space for the artefact | Git repo / wiki with history | team |
| Named owner | Person + role | team / RACI |
| Trigger event | Event / threshold / schedule | operating cadence |
| Upstream methodologies in `Assumes Loaded` | Already routine for the role | team training |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|-------------|-----|

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, scope, evidence presence, owner presence, cadence status) to a concrete action, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which variant of the methodology to apply.
