# Container Orchestration

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Kubernetes pod / Deployment / autoscaling / security manifest patterns — declarative model, probes, resource requests, PSS, network policies — emitted as a pre-merge manifest checklist that catches OOM, CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, and unready-pod traffic before production.

**One-paragraph:** Kubernetes pod / Deployment / autoscaling / security manifest patterns — declarative model, probes, resource requests, PSS, network policies — emitted as a pre-merge manifest checklist that catches OOM, CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, and unready-pod traffic before production. The methodology pins the discipline that turns folklore into a reviewable, owned, version-controlled operating artefact: rule-bound output contract, evidence anchors, named owner, published review cadence. Outputs of the wrong shape are rejected at review; outputs without evidence are demoted to hypotheses; outputs without owners are tagged stale.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- A team is producing config for the topic 'Container Orchestration'.
- Output is reviewed by a named human on a published cadence.
- Inputs and constraints fit the rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- One-shot work with no recurrence — write a single doc, not a versioned artefact.
- Regulated context that mandates a different template — use the regulator's.
- No named owner is available — defer until ownership is resolved.

**Ефективно для:**

- Pre-merge review of Deployment / StatefulSet / DaemonSet manifests.
- Choosing deployment strategy for a high-risk release (canary vs blue-green vs rolling).
- Queue-backed / event-driven autoscaling with KEDA.
- Hardening pods: RBAC, network policies, pod security standards (PSS).
- Triage runbook: OOMKilled, CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, traffic-to-unready.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Versioned space for the artefact | Git repo / wiki with history | team |
| Named owner | Person + role | team / RACI |
| Trigger event | Event / threshold / schedule | operating cadence |
| Upstream methodologies in `Assumes Loaded` | Already routine for the role | team training |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| `solo/dev/software-architect/architecture-decision-records` | Base ADR format the output extends. |
| `pro/dev/software-architect` | Role/operating context. |

## Content (load on demand)

| File | Depth | What's inside | Est. tokens |
|------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `content/01-core-rules.xml` | essential | 6 testable rules with rationale + source | 1100 |
| `content/02-output-contract.xml` | essential | JSON Schema (draft-07) + valid/invalid/forbidden examples | 900 |
| `content/03-failure-modes.xml` | essential | 5 antipatterns with symptom / root-cause / fix | 800 |
| `content/04-procedure.xml` | essential | Step-by-step procedure to apply the methodology end-to-end | 800 |
| `content/06-decision-tree.xml` | essential | Routing tree on observable signals → rule from 01-core-rules.xml | 600 |

## Task Routing

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `scaffold-config` | haiku | Template fill of allow-lists + env-var blocks. |
| `populate-policy` | sonnet | Per-clause translation into config fields. |
| `breach-protocol-review` | opus | Cross-engagement risk + breach-response synthesis. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/policy.yaml` | YAML config skeleton with allow-list / deny-list / telemetry-overrides / audit-cadence. |
| `templates/_smoke-test.yaml` | Minimum viable filled policy. |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-container-orchestration.py` | Validate artefact against the JSON Schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml`. Stdlib-only. | CI on artefact change; pre-commit. |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, scope, evidence presence, owner presence, cadence status) to a concrete action, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which variant of the methodology to apply.
