# Invariant → test mapping

| # | Invariant | Test name | Status |
|---|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Empty order cannot be placed | `test_cannot_place_empty_order` | scaffold |
| 2 | Order in `placed` cannot be modified | `test_cannot_modify_placed_order` | scaffold |
| 3 | Shipped order cannot be cancelled | `test_cannot_cancel_shipped_order` | scaffold |
| 4 | Only known customer_id allowed | `test_must_have_customer_id` | scaffold |

Each test:
1. Construct the aggregate in the precondition state.
2. Call the command method that should fail.
3. Assert the expected `DomainError` / `InvalidOperationException` was raised.
4. Confirm no event was appended on failure.
