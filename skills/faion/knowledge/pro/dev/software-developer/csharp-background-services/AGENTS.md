# C# Background Services

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Long-running in-process workers in ASP.NET Core via BackgroundService + Channels with bounded back-pressure, scoped DI, graceful shutdown, and health checks.

**One-paragraph:** Ad-hoc Task.Run loops bypass IHost lifecycle, ignore CancellationToken, and capture scoped DI as singletons. BackgroundService extends IHostedService and integrates with graceful shutdown, IHealthCheck, and System.Threading.Channels for in-memory queues with back-pressure. This methodology pins five testable rules: extend BackgroundService (never Task.Run), pass stoppingToken everywhere, catch per-item inside ExecuteAsync, CreateScope() for DbContext access, and Channel.CreateBounded with FullMode.Wait. Output: a worker class + DI registration + xUnit test conforming to the contract in `02-output-contract.xml`.

**Ефективно для:**

- Queue consumers, periodic cleanup, cache warming inside the API host.
- In-memory back-pressure between HTTP and background workers.
- Graceful shutdown coordination via CancellationToken propagation.
- IHealthCheck wiring for Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes.
- Moderate-throughput scheduled tasks where Hangfire/Quartz is overkill.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- The work must run inside the API host process (no separate Worker host).
- Jobs may be lost on shutdown — at-least-once with restart-tolerance is the goal.
- Throughput fits on a single replica or leader-elected replica.
- Graceful shutdown must drain in-flight work before stopping.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Jobs MUST survive restarts — use Hangfire, Quartz.NET, or a durable broker.
- Heavy CPU work — would starve the HTTP thread pool; isolate to a Worker host.
- Distributed scheduling across replicas without leader election.
- Exactly-once semantics — in-memory channels lose state on shutdown.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Job spec | Markdown | team / ticket |
| ASP.NET Core 6+ project | csproj | repo |
| DbContext or downstream service contract | C# interface | repo |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| [[csharp-dotnet]] | Base .NET wiring, DI, hosting model. |
| [[csharp-entity-framework]] | Scoped DbContext lifecycle the worker depends on. |

## Content (load on demand)

| File | Depth | What's inside | Est. tokens |
|------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `content/01-core-rules.xml` | essential | 5 testable rules: extend-backgroundservice, pass-stoppingtoken, per-item-trycatch, scope-per-item, bounded-channel | ~1100 |
| `content/02-output-contract.xml` | essential | JSON Schema for worker spec + valid/invalid examples + forbidden patterns | ~900 |
| `content/03-failure-modes.xml` | essential | 4 antipatterns: task-run-loop, unbounded-channel, captive-dbcontext, no-stoppingtoken | ~800 |
| `content/04-procedure.xml` | essential | 5-step procedure: classify → design channel → write worker → register + health → test | ~700 |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (job durability requirement, throughput, CPU profile, distribution) to a rule from `01-core-rules.xml` and either approves BackgroundService or redirects to a durable broker / Worker host. Use it whenever an engineer reaches for `Task.Run` or considers a hosted-service for periodic work.
