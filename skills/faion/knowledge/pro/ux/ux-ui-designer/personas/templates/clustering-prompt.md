Read these <N> interview transcripts. Group participants into 2-5 clusters by goals + behaviours (NOT demographics). For each cluster output:
- 3 representative verbatim quotes with participant IDs
- 3 shared goals
- 3 shared frustrations
- 1 contrasting cluster

Reject clusters supported by fewer than 2 participants. Refuse to invent quotes; if you cannot find verbatim support, mark the trait as `unsupported`.
