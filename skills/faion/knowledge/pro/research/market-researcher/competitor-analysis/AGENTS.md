# Competitor Analysis

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Structured competitor analysis report comparing 3-7 direct + 2-4 indirect competitors across pricing, positioning, distribution, GTM motion, and review-site sentiment with cited evidence per cell.

**One-paragraph:** Structured competitor analysis report comparing 3-7 direct + 2-4 indirect competitors across pricing, positioning, distribution, GTM motion, and review-site sentiment with cited evidence per cell. The methodology pins inputs to citable sources, runs ≥3 testable rules to reject fabricated or un-anchored outputs, and emits an artefact that a downstream agent or named human reviewer can sign off without re-deriving the reasoning. Decision tree in `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes the caller to apply-or-skip based on observable signals.

**Ефективно для:**

- Pre-launch positioning when target niche has 3+ visible players.
- Re-pricing decisions that need competitive context first.
- Sales-enablement battlecard construction.
- Quarterly market review where you must defend a price/feature stance.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- The triggering activity for competitor analysis appears in the user's workload at least once per cycle.
- The operator has authority to act on the artefact this methodology produces (write access, sign-off rights).
- A named consumer exists for the output — either a human reviewer or a downstream agent.
- An auditable source-of-truth is available for the inputs this methodology requires.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- One-off, never-to-repeat work — methodology overhead does not pay back.
- No named consumer for the artefact — output will be orphaned regardless of quality.
- Inputs are not available from a citable source-of-truth (paraphrased substitutes are worse than skipping).

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Input brief | Markdown or ticket | operator / upstream methodology |
| Source-of-truth refs | URLs, transcript ids, dashboard snapshots | external systems |
| Prior artefact (if any) | this methodology's prior output | repository / doc store |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree starts from observable input signals (presence of required prerequisites, fit of the triggering activity, availability of citable sources) and routes the caller to one of the rule conclusions in `content/01-core-rules.xml` — either apply the full methodology, apply a reduced variant, or skip and route to a sibling methodology.
