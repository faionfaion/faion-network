# Competitive Intelligence

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Ongoing competitor-monitoring report that ingests pricing pages, product changelogs, hiring posts, and review-site movement into a structured CI brief with cited deltas vs prior cycle.

**One-paragraph:** Ongoing competitor-monitoring report that ingests pricing pages, product changelogs, hiring posts, and review-site movement into a structured CI brief with cited deltas vs prior cycle. The methodology pins inputs to citable sources, runs ≥3 testable rules to reject fabricated or un-anchored outputs, and emits an artefact that a downstream agent or named human reviewer can sign off without re-deriving the reasoning. Decision tree in `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes the caller to apply-or-skip based on observable signals.

**Ефективно для:**

- Quarterly competitor pulse for a SaaS in a 3-10-player market.
- Pre-launch competitive scan before pricing-page publication.
- Reacting to a competitor's funding round or pivot announcement.
- Sales-enablement battlecard refresh every 90 days.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- The triggering activity for competitive intelligence appears in the user's workload at least once per cycle.
- The operator has authority to act on the artefact this methodology produces (write access, sign-off rights).
- A named consumer exists for the output — either a human reviewer or a downstream agent.
- An auditable source-of-truth is available for the inputs this methodology requires.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- One-off, never-to-repeat work — methodology overhead does not pay back.
- No named consumer for the artefact — output will be orphaned regardless of quality.
- Inputs are not available from a citable source-of-truth (paraphrased substitutes are worse than skipping).

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Input brief | Markdown or ticket | operator / upstream methodology |
| Source-of-truth refs | URLs, transcript ids, dashboard snapshots | external systems |
| Prior artefact (if any) | this methodology's prior output | repository / doc store |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-competitive-intelligence.py` | Validate the produced artefact against the JSON Schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml` | After subagent returns; pre-commit; CI on each artefact change |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree starts from observable input signals (presence of required prerequisites, fit of the triggering activity, availability of citable sources) and routes the caller to one of the rule conclusions in `content/01-core-rules.xml` — either apply the full methodology, apply a reduced variant, or skip and route to a sibling methodology.
