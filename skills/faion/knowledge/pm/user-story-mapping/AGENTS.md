# User Story Mapping

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Arrange user activities as a left-to-right backbone with tasks stacked vertically by priority; the walking skeleton is one task per activity, and every release slice spans the full backbone.

**One-paragraph:** Arrange user activities as a left-to-right backbone with tasks stacked vertically by priority; the walking skeleton is one task per activity, and every release slice spans the full backbone. The methodology pins the artefact: a fixed shape, a named owner, evidence anchors, and a published review cadence. It is loaded when the role named in the trigger starts the block and produces a committed artefact reviewed against outcomes at the next iteration.

**Ефективно для:**

- Operators who run User Story Mapping on a recurring cadence and need a reviewable operating tool.
- Solo founders who need a defensible artefact for stakeholder pressure.
- Teams syncing outcome work across PM, design, and engineering.
- Audit / review surface: every artefact has an owner, evidence anchors, and a decay date.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Feature spans ≥3 user activities and benefits from a 2D view.
- Backlog is flat and lost journey context.
- Cross-functional team needs a shared journey picture before sprint planning.
- MVP / walking-skeleton needs to be identified from a larger scope.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Pure technical work (refactor / infra) — no user-facing backbone.
- Tiny single-flow feature — direct user stories suffice.
- No shared journey understanding yet — do journey-mapping or JTBD first.
- Single-screen UI — story map is overkill.

## Prerequisites

| `draft-user-story-mapping` | sonnet | Per-instance judgement; bounded inputs. |
| `validate-user-story-mapping` | haiku | Schema check + threshold checks; deterministic. |
| `review-user-story-mapping` | opus | Cross-cycle synthesis; high-stakes changes to policy / cadence. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/user-story-mapping.json` | JSON skeleton conforming to the output contract schema. |
| `templates/user-story-mapping.md` | Markdown skeleton for human-readable artefact rendering. |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable inputs to one of the rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it before drafting the artefact: it decides apply-vs-skip and which rule path applies.
