# Serverless Architecture Patterns

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Routes a workload to the right serverless composition (API Gateway+Lambda, EventBridge, Step Functions, SQS fan-out) and emits a pattern ADR with cost + cold-start trade-offs.

**One-paragraph:** Routes a workload to the right serverless composition (API Gateway+Lambda, EventBridge, Step Functions, SQS fan-out) and emits a pattern ADR with cost + cold-start trade-offs. Decision tree, output contract, failure modes, and a procedure (when complexity ≥ medium) live under `content/`. Templates in `templates/` start with a 5-line `__faion_header__` block; the validator script in `scripts/` is stdlib-only with `--help` and `--self-test`.

**Ефективно для:**

- Workload is event-driven, bursty, or has variable traffic and fits FaaS execution limits.
- Operational team capacity is small; managed runtime preferred over self-hosted.
- Cost model favours pay-per-invocation over reserved capacity (long idle / spiky).
- Output produces `decision-record` matching the schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Workload is event-driven, bursty, or has variable traffic and fits FaaS execution limits.
- Operational team capacity is small; managed runtime preferred over self-hosted.
- Cost model favours pay-per-invocation over reserved capacity (long idle / spiky).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Workload requires sustained high RPS where reserved compute is cheaper per request.
- Long-running (> 15min on AWS) or stateful in-memory needs — choose containers / VMs.
- Sub-50ms p99 latency requirement where cold start is unacceptable.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Root question: *Is the workload pattern compatible with serverless prerequisites?* The tree's purpose is to route an input through observable signals to a conclusion that references a rule from `content/01-core-rules.xml`; the skip-this-methodology branch is always reachable so an inappropriate caller exits cleanly.
