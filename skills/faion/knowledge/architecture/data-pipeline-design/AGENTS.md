# Data Pipeline Design

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Pipeline design pass — medallion bronze/silver/gold tiers, idempotent tasks, DLQs, orchestrator choice (Airflow / Dagster), schema-evolution gates, data-quality validation — emitting a pipeline spec + orchestrator DAG skeleton.

**One-paragraph:** Pipeline design pass — medallion bronze/silver/gold tiers, idempotent tasks, DLQs, orchestrator choice (Airflow / Dagster), schema-evolution gates, data-quality validation — emitting a pipeline spec + orchestrator DAG skeleton. The methodology pins the discipline that turns folklore into a reviewable, owned, version-controlled operating artefact: rule-bound output contract, evidence anchors, named owner, published review cadence. Outputs of the wrong shape are rejected at review; outputs without evidence are demoted to hypotheses; outputs without owners are tagged stale.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- A team is producing spec for the topic 'Data Pipeline Design'.
- Output is reviewed by a named human on a published cadence.
- Inputs and constraints fit the rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- One-shot work with no recurrence — write a single doc, not a versioned artefact.
- Regulated context that mandates a different template — use the regulator's.
- No named owner is available — defer until ownership is resolved.

**Ефективно для:**

- Greenfield analytical or operational pipeline from sources to mart.
- Batch vs streaming decision under a stated latency SLA.
- Migrating ad-hoc ETL scripts to a managed orchestrator (Airflow / Dagster).
- Adding data-quality gates (great_expectations / dbt tests) to an existing pipeline.
- Reliability review: retries, dead-letter queues, schema evolution.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Versioned space for the artefact | Git repo / wiki with history | team |
| Named owner | Person + role | team / RACI |
| Trigger event | Event / threshold / schedule | operating cadence |
| Upstream methodologies in `Assumes Loaded` | Already routine for the role | team training |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| `solo/dev/software-architect/architecture-decision-records` | Base ADR format the output extends. |
| `pro/dev/software-architect` | Role/operating context. |

## Task Routing

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |

| `scaffold-spec` | haiku | Template fill from header + section list. |
| `populate-decisions` | sonnet | Per-section judgment + tradeoff selection. |
| `review-tradeoffs` | opus | Cross-decision synthesis when stakes are high. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/skeleton.md` | Markdown skeleton with required sections (overview / decisions / tradeoffs / fitness functions / open questions). |
| `templates/_smoke-test.md` | Minimum viable filled-in instance. |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-data-pipeline-design.py` | Validate artefact against the JSON Schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml`. Stdlib-only. | CI on artefact change; pre-commit. |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, scope, evidence presence, owner presence, cadence status) to a concrete action, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which variant of the methodology to apply.
