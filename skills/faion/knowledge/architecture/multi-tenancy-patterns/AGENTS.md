# Multi-Tenancy Patterns

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Decision framework for SaaS multi-tenancy isolation — shared-everything / schema-per-tenant / DB-per-tenant / hybrid — with quantified blast-radius math, cost economics, compliance scoping, and migration paths between models.

**One-paragraph:** Decision framework for SaaS multi-tenancy isolation — shared-everything / schema-per-tenant / DB-per-tenant / hybrid — with quantified blast-radius math, cost economics, compliance scoping, and migration paths between models. The methodology pins the discipline that turns folklore into a reviewable, owned, version-controlled operating artefact: rule-bound output contract, evidence anchors, named owner, published review cadence. Outputs of the wrong shape are rejected at review; outputs without evidence are demoted to hypotheses; outputs without owners are tagged stale.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- A team is producing decision-record for the topic 'Multi-Tenancy Patterns'.
- Output is reviewed by a named human on a published cadence.
- Inputs and constraints fit the rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- One-shot work with no recurrence — write a single doc, not a versioned artefact.
- Regulated context that mandates a different template — use the regulator's.
- No named owner is available — defer until ownership is resolved.

**Ефективно для:**

- Pre-launch SaaS choosing tenant-isolation model (shared / schema-per-tenant / DB-per-tenant / hybrid).
- Compliance-driven re-architecture from shared to per-tenant isolation.
- Noisy-neighbor problem in shared-everything tier.
- Documenting migration paths BETWEEN models when assumptions change.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Versioned space for the artefact | Git repo / wiki with history | team |
| Named owner | Person + role | team / RACI |
| Trigger event | Event / threshold / schedule | operating cadence |
| Upstream methodologies in `Assumes Loaded` | Already routine for the role | team training |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| `solo/dev/software-architect/architecture-decision-records` | Base ADR format the output extends. |
| `pro/dev/software-architect` | Role/operating context. |

## Scripts

|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-multi-tenancy-patterns.py` | Validate artefact against the JSON Schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml`. Stdlib-only. | CI on artefact change; pre-commit. |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, scope, evidence presence, owner presence, cadence status) to a concrete action, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which variant of the methodology to apply.
