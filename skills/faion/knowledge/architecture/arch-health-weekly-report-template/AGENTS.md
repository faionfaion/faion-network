# Architecture Health Weekly Report Template

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Weekly arch-health report: hot-spots, debt deltas, risk register movement, one decision-needed item.

**One-paragraph:** Weekly arch-health report: hot-spots, debt deltas, risk register movement, one decision-needed item. Mechanism: typed input → bounded transformation → contract-checked output. The artefact carries owner + version + last_reviewed so downstream consumers can verify freshness.

**Ефективно для:**

- Weekly architecture report з hot-spot deltas і risk movement.
- Single 'decision needed' item, який вимагатиме рішення комітету цього тижня.
- Tracking debt delta тиждень-до-тижня (а не накопичений borrow).

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Team has ≥1 architect who owns the report.
- Codebase has ≥6 months of history with measurable hot-spot data.
- Leadership expects weekly visibility on architecture risk.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Codebase younger than 6 months — noise dominates the signal.
- Team has <8 engineers — informal sync is sufficient.
- No named architect — report has no owner.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree routes observable signals (input shape, evidence quality, scope, stakes) to a concrete action; every leaf references a rule id from `01-core-rules.xml` so the chosen action is grounded in a testable rule. Use it when in doubt about which variant of the methodology to apply.
