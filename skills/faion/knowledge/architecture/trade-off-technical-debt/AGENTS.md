# Technical Debt Trade-off Framework

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Classifies a piece of technical debt on the Fowler quadrant, sizes the 15-20% debt budget, and emits a debt item with explicit repayment trigger.

**One-paragraph:** Technical debt is the implied cost of rework caused by choosing an easier solution now. This methodology emits a debt-record: Fowler-quadrant classification (deliberate/inadvertent x reckless/prudent), severity (localized vs systemic), repayment trigger (observable, not "someday"), and budget impact against the project's 15-20% debt allocation. Output drives the ADR Decision section and the team's debt backlog.

**Ефективно для:**

- Solo architect tagging shortcuts taken under deadline pressure with their repayment criteria.
- Reviewing accumulated debt before adding a new feature in the same code area.
- Quarterly prioritisation of which debt items to pay down within the 15-20% budget.
- Communicating debt severity to a non-technical founder when refactor competes with new feature.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Shortcut affects a code area that will be touched again within 12 months.
- The "easier solution" is shippable now AND a "better solution" exists with known cost.
- Project has (or can have) a debt backlog tracked beside the feature backlog.
- Decision is deliberate (you see two options) — not retro-discovered.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Code area will not be touched for 2+ years — debt is not debt if interest is never paid; document and accept.
- Decision is actually an architectural flaw (foundation-level wrong) — escalate to ATAM, not debt.
- One-off prototype that will be thrown away — debt is irrelevant.
- The "better solution" has no known cost — first do a spike to size it.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Shortcut description | what we shipped vs the better option | architect / dev |
| Touch-frequency estimate | times/quarter this code is edited | git log + roadmap |
| Debt backlog | existing debt items + current total budget | project tracker |
| Project debt budget | percent of capacity allocated (15-20%) | architect / PM |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree gates on (a) Fowler quadrant — inadvertent-reckless escalates to ATAM not debt, (b) touch frequency — <1/quarter routes to "document and accept", (c) budget headroom — over-budget blocks new debt and forces repayment first. Every leaf references a rule in `01-core-rules.xml`.
