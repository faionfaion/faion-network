# Technology Stack Selection Decision Tree

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Picks a backend language + framework + datastore by walking team-expertise, performance-need, ecosystem-fit, and hiring-supply branches; emits a stack ADR with rejected alternatives.

**One-paragraph:** Picks a backend language + framework + datastore by walking team-expertise, performance-need, ecosystem-fit, and hiring-supply branches; emits a stack ADR with rejected alternatives. Decision tree, output contract, failure modes, and a procedure (when complexity ≥ medium) live under `content/`. Templates in `templates/` start with a 5-line `__faion_header__` block; the validator script in `scripts/` is stdlib-only with `--help` and `--self-test`.

**Ефективно для:**

- Greenfield service / module that owns its own runtime and dependencies.
- Major rewrite where current stack is the binding constraint.
- Adopting a new language / framework for a specific workload (ML, real-time, embedded).
- Output produces `decision-record` matching the schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Greenfield service / module that owns its own runtime and dependencies.
- Major rewrite where current stack is the binding constraint.
- Adopting a new language / framework for a specific workload (ML, real-time, embedded).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Stack mandated by org-wide platform policy — record the constraint and skip.
- Library swap inside an existing service — that is a dependency decision, not a stack decision.
- Throwaway prototype with < 1-month expected lifetime.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Team expertise inventory | table (language → headcount → senior years) | team |
| Performance / scaling target | RPS / p95 / GB targets | PM / SRE |
| Hiring market signal | table (language → 6-month hire success) | HR / lead |
| Ecosystem dependencies | list of must-have libraries / SDKs | team |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Root question: *Are all four prerequisites populated (expertise, perf, hiring, ecosystem)?* The tree's purpose is to route an input through observable signals to a conclusion that references a rule from `content/01-core-rules.xml`; the skip-this-methodology branch is always reachable so an inappropriate caller exits cleanly.
