# Puppeteer Session Management

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a Puppeteer session layer using userDataDir per logical identity, explicit cookie serialisation as a secondary mechanism, isolated browser contexts per parallel job, and a daemonised runner for long-lived sessions.

**One-paragraph:** Sessions in Puppeteer come from two mechanisms: userDataDir (full Chromium profile: cookies, storage, cert cache) and explicit cookies via page.setCookie/page.cookies. userDataDir per identity is the primary choice — it survives complex login flows including HSTS pinning. Explicit cookie serialisation is a secondary path for simple cases. Parallel jobs MUST use distinct browser.createIncognitoBrowserContext to isolate state. Long-lived sessions live in a daemonised runner the agent talks to over HTTP/queue, not in the LLM turn. The artefact is the session config; the validator enforces the canonical fields.

**Ефективно для:**

- Multi-tenant scrapers running parallel jobs against the same target.
- Workers reusing an existing logged-in session across many runs.
- Daemonised browser runners called via queue or HTTP.
- Tests needing isolated state per scenario.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Worker authenticates to a target site and reuses the session many times.
- Multiple jobs run concurrently and must not see each other's state.
- Auth flow is non-trivial (HSTS pin, MFA setup) and userDataDir simplifies it.
- Daemon process is acceptable for the deployment target.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- One-off scripts with no auth.
- Single-shot login flows where storageState (Playwright) is a better fit.
- Pure stateless scraping of public pages.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Number of logical identities | 1 | N | task brief |
| Parallelism plan | single | concurrent N | ops plan |
| Session lifetime | per-run | persistent | daemon | deploy plan |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| [[puppeteer-launch-setup]] | launch wrapper invoked with userDataDir option |
| [[puppeteer-agent-workflow]] | long-lived sessions live behind a queue, never inline |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
