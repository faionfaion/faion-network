# Trunk-Based Branch by Abstraction

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a Branch-by-Abstraction plan that follows the five steps (Protocol → wrap old → implement new → flag-gated swap → remove old + collapse abstraction), with a step-5 cleanup ticket filed at step-1 merge time.

**One-paragraph:** Branch by Abstraction (BbA) is how teams refactor on trunk without long-lived branches. The methodology produces a five-step plan: (1) introduce an interface/Protocol; (2) wrap the old implementation behind it; (3) implement the new code behind the same interface; (4) flag-gate the swap and validate in production; (5) remove the old implementation and collapse the abstraction back to a direct call. Step 5 is the most-skipped step; this methodology files the step-5 cleanup ticket at step-1 merge time so the obligation outlives the implementation work.

**Ефективно для:**

- Large refactor that cannot fit in a single PR < 200 lines.
- Migrating a payment / auth / storage layer to a new implementation.
- Breaking a long-lived feature branch into a series of trunk-merged increments.
- Replacing a legacy library while keeping production stable.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Project uses feature flags (any provider).
- Codebase compiles + tests green on trunk continuously.
- Refactor target has an interface boundary OR one can be introduced cheaply.
- Team agrees to the step-5 cleanup obligation up front.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Tiny refactors that fit in a single < 200-line PR.
- Trivial renames/internal cleanups without behaviour change.
- Projects without feature-flag infrastructure (apply feature-flags first).
- Cases where the abstraction itself is desirable long-term (then step 5 changes; document explicitly).

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
