# Puppeteer Stealth & Proxy

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a Puppeteer stealth + proxy layer using one documented evasion stance (plugin or manual, never both), proxy rotation with circuit breaker on 4xx, and bounded retries.

**One-paragraph:** Stealth and proxy mistakes have one root cause: layering. This methodology requires picking exactly one evasion stance (puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth alone OR manual navigator overrides alone) and documenting it. Proxy rotation uses a small bounded pool with health checks; 429/403 responses trip a circuit breaker that surfaces to the caller instead of silent looping. The artefact is the stealth + proxy config metadata; the validator enforces the canonical fields.

**Ефективно для:**

- Scrapers against targets with mild bot detection (signature checks, no Turnstile).
- Pipelines requiring rotating IPs for rate-limit avoidance.
- Workers using managed browser services (Browserless, ScrapingBee) with retry policies.
- Auditing existing scripts that mix stealth plugin + manual overrides (and breaking from there).

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Target has signature-based bot detection (navigator props, WebGL fingerprint) but not aggressive challenge pages.
- Run budget allows multiple retries against rate-limited responses.
- Proxy pool available (residential or DC) with health monitoring.
- Worker can surface circuit-breaker trips to the caller.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Targets with hardened bot defence (Cloudflare Turnstile aggressive, Akamai BMP) — use a managed solver instead.
- Public APIs with documented rate limits — call the API, not the page.
- Local dev where no proxy is needed.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Stealth stance choice | plugin | manual | none | team decision |
| Proxy pool | list of endpoints + auth + health URL | ops provided |
| Retry policy | max retries + backoff + circuit-breaker threshold | task brief |

| Methodology | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| [[puppeteer-launch-setup]] | launch wrapper accepts proxy + extra args |
| [[puppeteer-agent-workflow]] | worker exits non-zero with status on circuit breaker |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
