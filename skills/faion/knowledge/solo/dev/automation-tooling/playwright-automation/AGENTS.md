# Playwright Automation

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Generates a Playwright test or scraping script using role-based locators, auto-wait, storageState auth reuse, and on-first-retry trace capture.

**One-paragraph:** Playwright is a cross-browser automation library (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit) with first-class auto-wait, trace viewer, and storageState auth reuse. This methodology produces a Playwright TypeScript test or one-off mjs scraping script that uses role/label/text locators (never CSS unless no semantic role exists), never page.waitForTimeout, authenticates once via storageState, and configures trace='on-first-retry' + screenshot='only-on-failure' to keep CI artefact size manageable.

**Ефективно для:**

- Cross-browser E2E tests (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit) with auto-waiting and trace viewer.
- Agentic web tasks: login flows, form filling, scraping requiring JS execution.
- Visual regression via toHaveScreenshot() snapshots + diff threshold.
- Authenticate once via storageState and reuse across hundreds of headless agent runs.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Cross-browser E2E tests (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit) with auto-waiting and trace viewer.
- Agentic web tasks: login flows, form filling, scraping requiring JS execution.
- Visual regression testing via toHaveScreenshot() snapshots.
- API testing alongside UI in one session (page.request).
- Replacing legacy Selenium/Cypress suites for speed and reliability.
- Authenticating once, reusing storageState across many headless agent runs.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Pure HTTP scraping where the target renders server-side (use httpx/fetch, 100x cheaper).
- Mobile-app E2E testing (use Appium, Detox, Maestro).
- Sub-millisecond unit tests of UI components (use Vitest + Testing Library).
- Targets with hard bot-detection (Cloudflare Turnstile aggressive mode).
- Long-lived stateful sessions (hours) — use a real browser profile.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
