# Serverless Cold Start Optimization

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Cold-start mitigation spec for FaaS: runtime + memory + bundle-size + provisioned concurrency / SnapStart choice, with measured before/after p99 numbers.

**One-paragraph:** Cold-start mitigation spec for FaaS: runtime + memory + bundle-size + provisioned concurrency / SnapStart choice, with measured before/after p99 numbers. Decision tree, output contract, failure modes, and a procedure (when complexity ≥ medium) live under `content/`. Templates in `templates/` start with a 5-line `__faion_header__` block; the validator script in `scripts/` is stdlib-only with `--help` and `--self-test`.

**Ефективно для:**

- Function on a sync request path with p99 latency budget < 1s.
- Cold-start frequency observable in production (idle > N minutes).
- Latency SLO miss attributed to cold starts in incident analysis.
- Output produces `spec` matching the schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Function on a sync request path with p99 latency budget < 1s.
- Cold-start frequency observable in production (idle > N minutes).
- Latency SLO miss attributed to cold starts in incident analysis.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Async event consumer with no user-facing latency budget.
- Workload is steady high-RPS where cold starts are negligible.
- Function already meets SLO with healthy headroom.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Latency budget (p50/p95/p99) | table | SRE |
| Baseline cold/warm latency measurement | data | QA / SRE |
| Runtime + memory config | deployment yaml | ops |
| Bundle size + import graph | data | team |

| File | Depth | What's inside | Est. tokens |

## Task Routing

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `measure-baseline` | haiku | Aggregate CloudWatch / Stackdriver cold vs warm latency. |
| `pick-mitigation` | sonnet | Bounded judgement: runtime swap vs PC vs SnapStart vs container. |
| `update-deployment` | haiku | Mechanical: edit IaC config + redeploy. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/cold-start-spec.md` | Spec capturing baseline + chosen mitigation + post-fix numbers. |
| `templates/lambda-config.yaml` | Sample Lambda config with provisioned concurrency + SnapStart settings. |
| `templates/_smoke-test.md` | Minimum viable filled-in artefact for sanity-checking the schema. |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-serverless-cold-start-optimization.py` | Validate the produced artefact against the schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml`. | Pre-commit; CI on each artefact change; `--self-test` in dev. |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Root question: *Are all four prerequisites populated (budget, baseline, runtime, bundle)?* The tree's purpose is to route an input through observable signals to a conclusion that references a rule from `content/01-core-rules.xml`; the skip-this-methodology branch is always reachable so an inappropriate caller exits cleanly.
