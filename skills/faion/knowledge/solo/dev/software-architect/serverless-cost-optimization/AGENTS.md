# Serverless Cost Optimization

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Cost-reduction report for a serverless workload: memory right-sizing, batching, downstream call reduction, idle-PC removal; ships before/after spend + break-even RPS vs containers.

**One-paragraph:** Cost-reduction report for a serverless workload: memory right-sizing, batching, downstream call reduction, idle-PC removal; ships before/after spend + break-even RPS vs containers. Decision tree, output contract, failure modes, and a procedure (when complexity ≥ medium) live under `content/`. Templates in `templates/` start with a 5-line `__faion_header__` block; the validator script in `scripts/` is stdlib-only with `--help` and `--self-test`.

**Ефективно для:**

- Lambda / Functions monthly bill > $500 OR > 30% of total cloud spend.
- Workload showing under-utilisation (PC > 50% idle, memory > 2× p95 used).
- FinOps mandate to reduce cloud cost or improve unit economics.
- Output produces `report` matching the schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Lambda / Functions monthly bill > $500 OR > 30% of total cloud spend.
- Workload showing under-utilisation (PC > 50% idle, memory > 2× p95 used).
- FinOps mandate to reduce cloud cost or improve unit economics.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Workload spend < $100/month — optimisation overhead exceeds savings.
- Architecture migration to containers already planned — focus there.
- SLO already at risk; perf-first work has priority.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Monthly Lambda / Functions cost broken down by function | billing data | FinOps |
| Function-level metrics (memory used p95, duration p95, RPS) | metrics data | SRE |
| Downstream service cost (DynamoDB, SQS, S3 PUT) | billing data | FinOps |
| Provisioned concurrency config + utilisation | data | ops |

## Task Routing

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `inventory-spend` | haiku | Aggregate per-function cost + memory + duration. |
| `right-size` | sonnet | Bounded recommendation per function. |
| `batch-and-reduce-downstream` | sonnet | Identify request batching + downstream call reduction opportunities. |
| `publish-report` | sonnet | Compose cost report with before/after. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/cost-report.md` | Report skeleton: per-function before/after + actions + savings. |
| `templates/memory-tuning.json` | AWS Lambda Power Tuning input/output sample. |
| `templates/_smoke-test.md` | Minimum viable filled-in artefact for sanity-checking the schema. |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-serverless-cost-optimization.py` | Validate the produced artefact against the schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml`. | Pre-commit; CI on each artefact change; `--self-test` in dev. |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Root question: *Are all four prerequisites populated (billing, metrics, downstream cost, PC data)?* The tree's purpose is to route an input through observable signals to a conclusion that references a rule from `content/01-core-rules.xml`; the skip-this-methodology branch is always reachable so an inappropriate caller exits cleanly.
