# A/B Testing

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Run a pre-registered controlled experiment (control vs variant) on a live population with a primary metric, guardrails, and pre-calculated sample size to decide ship/hold on evidence.

**One-paragraph:** Run a pre-registered controlled experiment (control vs variant) on a live population with a primary metric, guardrails, and pre-calculated sample size to decide ship/hold on evidence.

**Ефективно для:**

- Solo founders or small teams shipping under time pressure.
- Cross-functional reviewers needing a shared, evidence-grounded artefact.
- Methodology owners maintaining quality gates over time.
- Subagent pipelines that need a deterministic output shape.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Change has one clear primary metric (conversion, click-through, retention).
- Traffic supports at least 1,000 conversions per month per variant.
- Exactly one variable changes between control and variant.
- Engineering can route traffic and tag events at session granularity.
- Stakeholders agree to stop or extend strictly per pre-registered rule.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Traffic below ~1,000 conversions per month — results will be inconclusive.
- Major redesign with multiple simultaneous changes — confounds prevent attribution.
- Question is 'why' users behave a certain way — run user interviews instead.
- Regulatory or safety-critical change — split exposure carries risk.
- Early-stage product where the primary metric is itself unclear.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable inputs to one of the rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it before drafting the artefact: it decides apply-vs-skip and which rule path applies.
