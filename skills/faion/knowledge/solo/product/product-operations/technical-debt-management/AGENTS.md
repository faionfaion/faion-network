# Technical Debt Management

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Maintain a debt register, budget 10-20% of capacity for debt work per sprint, prioritise by interest rate (cost-of-living-with × likelihood-of-incident), and refuse zero-debt sprints.

**One-paragraph:** Tech debt is treated as a managed liability, not a moral failing. Each item carries an interest rate (cost of carrying × likelihood of incident); each sprint pays a 10-20% budget; the register prevents debt from being invisible. Zero-debt sprints are forbidden because they always reappear as crisis sprints.

**Ефективно для:**

- Solo dev with a 14-month codebase already groaning under inherited choices; needs a forcing function to keep paying down debt without sacrificing every feature.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Codebase ≥3 months old.
- Team capacity is measurable per sprint / cycle.
- Stakeholder pressure to ship features risks crowding out debt work.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Greenfield <1 month old — no debt accumulated.
- Pure throwaway prototype — never going to maintain.
- Crisis sprint stabilising production — debt work pauses.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Codebase access | credential | Repo |
| Sprint capacity (person-days) | integer | Team plan |
| Interest-rate rubric | table | Team doc |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| `solo/product/product-operations/backlog-management` | Debt register is a state in the backlog. |
| `solo/dev/code-quality (free tier)` | Practices that reduce new debt creation. |

## Content (load on demand)

| File | Depth | What's inside | Est. tokens |
|------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `content/01-core-rules.xml` | essential | ≥5 testable rules + skip + run rules | 800 |
| `content/02-output-contract.xml` | essential | JSON Schema (draft-07) + valid/invalid examples + forbidden patterns | 900 |

## Task Routing

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `draft-technical-debt-management` | sonnet | Per-instance judgement on the artefact; bounded inputs. |
| `validate-technical-debt-management` | haiku | Schema check + threshold checks; deterministic. |
| `review-technical-debt-management` | opus | Cross-cycle synthesis; high-stakes change to policy / cadence. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/technical-debt-management.json` | JSON skeleton conforming to the output contract schema. |
| `templates/technical-debt-management.md` | Markdown skeleton for human-readable artefact rendering. |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-technical-debt-management.py` | Validates a filled artefact JSON against the output-contract schema. | Pre-merge + scheduled review. |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable inputs to one of the rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it before drafting the artefact: it decides apply-vs-skip and which rule path applies.
