# Product Lifecycle

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Place the product in one of five lifecycle stages (idea / launch / growth / maturity / decline) and apply the stage-specific playbook so the operating model matches reality.

**One-paragraph:** A product's operating model differs per lifecycle stage; running launch tactics in maturity wastes capital, and running maturity tactics at launch starves growth. The template forces a stage assessment with ≥3 signals and routes to the stage-specific playbook.

**Ефективно для:**

- Solo founder unsure whether to keep pouring fuel into growth, defend margins, or sunset gracefully — needs a stage check before the next quarter's plan.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Product has at least 1 user cohort with known behaviour.
- Quarterly planning is happening or imminent.
- Stage is genuinely ambiguous (any two of growth/maturity/decline plausible).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Pre-product phase — lifecycle does not apply.
- Crisis mode — stage assessment after stabilisation, not during.
- Stage is unambiguously known and current playbook fits.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable inputs to one of the rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it before drafting the artefact: it decides apply-vs-skip and which rule path applies.
