# Minimum Product Frameworks

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Pick one of four minimum-product frames (MVP / MLP / MMP / MMR) for the current goal, document the trade-off, and run the matching planning methodology.

**One-paragraph:** Different goals demand different 'minimum' framings: MVP for learning, MLP for love, MMP for marketable, MMR for revenue. The decision matrix maps goal → frame → downstream methodology. Picking wrong = building a Minimum Lovable Product when you needed an MVP (or vice versa).

**Ефективно для:**

- Solo founder who keeps hearing different acronyms (MVP/MLP/MMP) and isn't sure which fits — needs a decision matrix that maps current goal to the right framework.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Goal is set for the next ship (learn / love / market / monetise).
- Multiple frames plausible — needs disambiguation.
- Downstream methodology will be picked from the frame.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Goal is genuinely ambiguous — fix that first.
- Frame is locked by external constraint (e.g. investor mandate).
- Single-day patch — no framework needed.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable inputs to one of the rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it before drafting the artefact: it decides apply-vs-skip and which rule path applies.
