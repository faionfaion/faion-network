# API Monitoring

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Production monitoring config: Prometheus RED-method metrics, structured JSON logs with request_id, split liveness/readiness probes, and SLO definitions that drive alerts.

**One-paragraph:** SLOs come first; metrics serve them. The methodology pins RED-method metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration) per endpoint, structured JSON logs correlated by request_id, separated liveness vs readiness probes (kill vs route-out), and a named SLO per critical user-journey with an error budget. Output is the monitoring config artefact + the alert ruleset. Decision tree in `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes the caller to apply-or-skip based on observable signals; the validator script enforces the output contract before the orchestrator accepts the artefact.

**Ефективно для:**

- API Monitoring — fits when the triggering activity recurs and the artefact needs to be auditable.
- Solo operator who wants a fixed template instead of improvising under pressure.
- Downstream consumer (human reviewer or agent) who must sign off without re-deriving the reasoning.
- Recurring cycle (sprint, weekly, per-incident) rather than a one-off task.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- The triggering activity for `api-monitoring` appears in the operator's workload at least once per cycle.
- The operator has authority to act on the artefact this methodology produces (write access, sign-off rights).
- A named consumer exists for the output — either a human reviewer or a downstream agent.
- An auditable source-of-truth is available for the inputs this methodology requires.
- API runs in production OR pre-production with traffic.
- Operator can host or pay for a metrics backend (Prometheus, Grafana Cloud, Datadog).
- ≥1 critical user-journey deserves an SLO + error budget.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- One-off, never-to-repeat work — methodology overhead does not pay back.
- No named consumer for the artefact — output will be orphaned regardless of quality.
- Inputs are not available from a citable source-of-truth (paraphrased substitutes are worse than skipping).
- Local dev-only service with no production exposure — `print()` debugging is enough.
- Static asset CDN already covered by upstream monitoring — extra metrics are noise.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Routes (backend choice, SLO maturity, alert pager budget) to full RED+SLO / minimal-RED-only / cloud-managed-only. Every leaf cites a rule from `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it before drafting the artefact: it decides apply-vs-skip, picks any variant, and ties the chosen leaf to the rule the orchestrator must enforce.
