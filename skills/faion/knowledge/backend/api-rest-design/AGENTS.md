# API REST Design

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Resource-oriented HTTP API design spec: noun-based URLs, correct HTTP verb semantics, idempotency guarantees, standard status codes, optional HATEOAS links.

**One-paragraph:** REST design errors compound: verbs in URLs lead to RPC drift, mixed status codes confuse clients, missing idempotency makes retries unsafe. The methodology pins noun URLs, the per-verb semantics table (GET safe + idempotent, POST creates, PUT replaces idempotently, PATCH merges, DELETE removes), the status code map, and the Idempotency-Key header policy for unsafe verbs. Output is the REST design spec. Decision tree in `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes the caller to apply-or-skip based on observable signals; the validator script enforces the output contract before the orchestrator accepts the artefact.

**Ефективно для:**

- API REST Design — fits when the triggering activity recurs and the artefact needs to be auditable.
- Solo operator who wants a fixed template instead of improvising under pressure.
- Downstream consumer (human reviewer or agent) who must sign off without re-deriving the reasoning.
- Recurring cycle (sprint, weekly, per-incident) rather than a one-off task.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- The triggering activity for `api-rest-design` appears in the operator's workload at least once per cycle.
- The operator has authority to act on the artefact this methodology produces (write access, sign-off rights).
- A named consumer exists for the output — either a human reviewer or a downstream agent.
- An auditable source-of-truth is available for the inputs this methodology requires.
- Greenfield API or significant rewrite touching URL structure.
- API exposes CRUD-shaped resources (users, orders, items) — REST fits.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- One-off, never-to-repeat work — methodology overhead does not pay back.
- No named consumer for the artefact — output will be orphaned regardless of quality.
- Inputs are not available from a citable source-of-truth (paraphrased substitutes are worse than skipping).
- API is fundamentally RPC-shaped (jobs, actions, workflows) — JSON-RPC or gRPC is honest; do not force REST.
- Operator already locked into a non-REST style with production traffic — migration cost outweighs purity.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Routes (resource shape, idempotency need, hypermedia maturity) to full-REST / pragmatic-REST / not-REST-use-RPC. Every leaf cites a rule from `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it before drafting the artefact: it decides apply-vs-skip, picks any variant, and ties the chosen leaf to the rule the orchestrator must enforce.
