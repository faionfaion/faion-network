# Cache Write Patterns (Cache-Aside, Write-Through, Write-Behind) — cwp-smoke-001

- **artefact_id**: cwp-smoke-001
- **owner**: alice@acme.com
- **status**: active
- **version**: 1.0.0
- **last_reviewed**: 2026-05-23

## Decision

Write-through with transactional outbox; DELETE-on-write to user-session-cache; retry budget 3× with back-off; alert on cache_write_fail metric.

## Rationale

Decision cites the scope doc (input A) and the workload sample (input B). The scenario is the canonical instance for this gap; the rationale exceeds the 60-character floor and names every input it relies on.

## Inputs used

- scope_doc — repo:engagements/acme/scope.md
- workload_sample — repo:engagements/acme/workload.csv

## Notes

Ready for owner review; supersedes none.
