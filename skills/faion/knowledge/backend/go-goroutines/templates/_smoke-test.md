# Go Goroutines and Worker Patterns — gogr-smoke-001

- **artefact_id**: gogr-smoke-001
- **owner**: alice@acme.com
- **status**: active
- **version**: 1.0.0
- **last_reviewed**: 2026-05-23

## Decision

Refresher: ticker + ctx, in WaitGroup. Side-effect: bounded pool of 100, ctx cancel on shutdown; both tested with goleak.

## Rationale

Decision cites the scope doc (input A) and the workload sample (input B). The scenario is the canonical instance for this gap; the rationale exceeds the 60-character floor and names every input it relies on.

## Inputs used

- scope_doc — repo:engagements/acme/scope.md
- workload_sample — repo:engagements/acme/workload.csv

## Notes

Ready for owner review; supersedes none.
