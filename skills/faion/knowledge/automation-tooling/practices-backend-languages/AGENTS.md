# Backend Languages Practices

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a backend service scaffold in Go/Rails/Laravel/Spring Boot/.NET/Rust enforcing the canonical layout, error model, DI shape, and async discipline for the chosen language.

**One-paragraph:** Reference patterns for six backend languages. Go: cmd/internal/pkg layout, wrapped errors via fmt.Errorf with %w, consumer-side interfaces, worker-pool concurrency. Ruby on Rails: thin controllers + service/form/query objects. PHP Laravel: controller -> Form Request -> Service. Java Spring Boot: constructor injection (no @Autowired on fields), @Service @RequiredArgsConstructor, builder DTOs. C# .NET: IService interfaces + DI, async Task<T> throughout. Rust: thiserror Result types, tokio for async, no blocking I/O inside async fns. The artefact is the language tag + scaffold metadata; the validator checks the canonical fields per language are present.

**Ефективно для:**

- Greenfield service scaffolding in any of the six languages.
- Cross-language onboarding: produce equivalent service shape in two stacks.
- Code-review gate — check Go interfaces are consumer-side, Spring uses constructor injection, Rust async has no blocking calls.
- Refactor passes aligning an existing module to the known-good shape.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Greenfield service scaffolding in one of Go, Rails, Laravel, Spring Boot, .NET, Rust.
- Cross-language onboarding where shape parity matters.
- Refactor passes aligning existing modules to canonical layout.
- Code-review gates checking idiomatic patterns per language.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Architecture decisions (microservices vs monolith) — out of scope.
- Performance profiling or observability — out of scope.
- Frontend code — see practices-frontend-components / practices-js-ts-stack.
- Project already has a documented house style that diverges — agent will overwrite.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Target language | one of: go | rails | laravel | spring | dotnet | rust | team decision |
| Service name + intended public surface | free text + endpoint list | task brief |
| DI framework (when applicable) | Spring / Symfony container / built-in | language defaults |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
