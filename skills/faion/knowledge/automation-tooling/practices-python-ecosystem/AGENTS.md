# Python Ecosystem Practices

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a Python project baseline: pyproject.toml with ruff + mypy strict, uv/pip-tools lock, src/ layout, py.typed marker, pre-commit hooks, CI gate.

**One-paragraph:** Modern Python baseline: pyproject.toml (PEP 621) is the single source of truth; src/ layout to prevent accidental imports from the working dir; ruff for format + lint (replaces black + isort + flake8); mypy --strict for type checks; uv or pip-tools for deterministic lockfile; py.typed marker if shipping a typed library; pre-commit hooks running ruff + mypy on staged files; CI runs ruff check + mypy + pytest. The artefact is the project metadata; the validator checks the canonical fields are present.

**Ефективно для:**

- New Python project or library being scaffolded.
- Brownfield project migrating from setup.py to pyproject.toml.
- Adding ruff + mypy strict + pre-commit to a legacy repo.
- Wiring CI to enforce ruff check + mypy + pytest on every push.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Python 3.10+ (PEP 604 union types + structural pattern matching available).
- Project ships a pyproject.toml as the build/config source of truth.
- Test runner is pytest.
- Lockfile manager is uv or pip-tools (no Poetry-specific behaviour required).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Pure data-science notebooks with no installable package.
- Cython/extension-heavy projects requiring custom setup.py logic that pyproject can't express.
- Internal one-file scripts shipped via pipx without a project metadata file.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Python >= 3.10 | binary on PATH | developer machine |
| Project name + minimum supported Python version | string + version | task brief |
| Library or application? | lib | app | team decision |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| [[testing-django-pytest]] | shares pytest conventions; out-of-scope here |

## Content (load on demand)

| File | Depth | What's inside | Est. tokens |
|------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `content/01-core-rules.xml` | essential | 6 testable rules with rationale + source | 1200 |
| `content/02-output-contract.xml` | essential | JSON Schema draft-07 + valid/invalid examples + forbidden patterns | 900 |
| `content/03-failure-modes.xml` | essential | 5 antipatterns with symptom/root-cause/fix | 800 |
| `content/04-procedure.xml` | essential | 7-step procedure | 900 |

## Task Routing

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `emit-pyproject` | haiku | render pyproject.toml from template + project name |
| `emit-ruff-config` | sonnet | select ruff rule groups based on project shape |
| `emit-pre-commit` | haiku | render .pre-commit-config.yaml from template |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/pyproject.toml` | PEP 621 pyproject with ruff + mypy strict |
| `templates/.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Pre-commit hooks: ruff + mypy on staged files |
| `templates/ci.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow for Python |
| `templates/py-typed` | Empty marker advertising the library as typed (filename: py.typed) |
| `templates/artefact.json` | Sample artefact metadata for validator |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-practices-python-ecosystem.py` | Validate output artefact against the JSON Schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml` | CI on each artefact change; pre-commit; agent self-check |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
