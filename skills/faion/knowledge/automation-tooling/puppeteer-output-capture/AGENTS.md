# Puppeteer Output Capture (Screenshots, PDFs, HAR)

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a Puppeteer capture script that takes screenshots (jpeg/webp quality 80 for high volume), PDFs (printBackground true + waitForSelector before pdf), and HAR (with secret scrubber).

**One-paragraph:** Capturing artifacts from Puppeteer has a small set of recurring traps: PDF generation called before the page finished rendering, screenshots wasting storage by defaulting to PNG, and HAR files leaking session tokens. This methodology produces a capture module exposing screenshot(page, opts), pdf(page, opts), and har(page, opts) — each enforcing the correct defaults: jpeg/webp quality 80 for bulk pipelines, printBackground=true + waitForSelector anchor for PDFs, and HAR piped through a secret scrubber before persistence.

**Ефективно для:**

- Bulk screenshot pipeline storing/transmitting many images (size matters).
- PDF generation from rendered dashboards or invoices.
- HAR capture for downstream replay or audit.
- Adding consistent artifact discipline to an existing worker.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Worker uses Puppeteer 22+ with the new headless mode.
- Output artifacts are persisted to disk or object storage.
- Volume is high enough that PNG > JPEG cost difference matters.
- PDF/HAR outputs may contain secrets that need scrubbing.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- One-off debugging screenshots in dev; defaults are fine.
- Visual-regression testing where lossless PNG is required (use playwright-automation with toHaveScreenshot).
- Targets that already export PDFs server-side — let the backend do it.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
