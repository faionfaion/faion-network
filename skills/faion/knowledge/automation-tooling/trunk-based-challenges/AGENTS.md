# Trunk-Based Challenges & Diagnostics

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a diagnostic report when trunk breaks repeatedly, applying an ordered checklist (gates → CI speed → flags → PR size → review SLA) and recommending the first failing fix before touching downstream symptoms.

**One-paragraph:** Broken trunk is never caused by trunk-based development itself — it is caused by missing gates. This methodology produces a structured report given a frequency of trunk breaks. It applies an ordered checklist: (1) Are all merges gated by passing CI? (2) Is CI under 10 minutes? (3) Are incomplete features behind flags? (4) Are PRs under 200 lines? (5) Is review SLA under 4 hours? The first failing check is the fix priority; downstream symptoms are not addressed until the upstream gate is in place. The report names the broken practice, not the practice of trunk-based itself.

**Ефективно для:**

- Trunk breaks more than once per week and the team is considering abandoning trunk-based development.
- Code review is the bottleneck; PRs sit for days.
- CI takes longer than 10 minutes and developers are batching pushes.
- Long-lived branches are creeping back in with 'this feature is too big' justifications.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Team has adopted trunk-based development and is now experiencing pain.
- Trunk has broken more than once per week for the last month OR PRs queue > 8 hours.
- Leadership is asking 'should we drop trunk-based development?'
- Data available: CI logs, PR sizes, review times, flag inventory.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Teams that have not yet adopted trunk-based development (different methodology).
- Mobile/desktop release-branch projects where trunk-based development is not appropriate.
- Compliance projects with mandated release-cut points (different mode).

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
