# Frontend Component Practices

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a frontend component (React, Vue, Svelte, or Angular) following one-responsibility, typed props, accessibility-from-the-start, controlled-vs-uncontrolled separation, and CSS-isolation discipline.

**One-paragraph:** Component-level rules common to React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular: a component owns exactly one responsibility; props are typed (TS interface or PropTypes) and never spread blindly; ARIA roles/labels are present from day one; state is either controlled (parent owns the value) or uncontrolled (component owns it) but never both; styles are scoped (CSS modules / scoped CSS / styled-components) not global. The artefact is the component file + sibling .test + sibling .stories; the validator checks the canonical fields are present.

**Ефективно для:**

- New component in an existing frontend codebase.
- Refactor passes extracting a fat component into single-responsibility units.
- Accessibility audit fixes adding ARIA roles + keyboard handlers.
- Migrating uncontrolled <-> controlled in form components.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Component-based framework (React / Vue / Svelte / Angular) with a build step.
- TypeScript or PropTypes for prop typing.
- Component-level CSS scoping mechanism available (CSS modules, scoped <style>, etc).
- Test runner (Vitest / Jest / Testing Library / Playwright Component) wired.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Pure design-token work — see ui-designer methodology.
- Global layout / routing concerns — out of scope.
- Server-rendered HTML templates without a component model.
- Plain CSS site without a build step.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Framework + version | react@18|vue@3|svelte@4|angular@17 | package.json |
| Component spec | props list + states + intended a11y role | design hand-off |
| Styling system | css-modules|scoped|tailwind|styled-components | project convention |

## Content (load on demand)

| File | Depth | What's inside | Est. tokens |
|------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `content/01-core-rules.xml` | essential | 6 testable rules with rationale + source | 1200 |
| `content/02-output-contract.xml` | essential | JSON Schema draft-07 + valid/invalid examples + forbidden patterns | 900 |

## Task Routing

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `scaffold-component` | sonnet | create file + props interface + initial markup |
| `emit-a11y-attributes` | haiku | add role/aria-* based on spec |
| `write-sibling-test` | sonnet | Testing-Library test mirroring the public surface |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/Component.tsx` | React functional component with typed props + a11y |
| `templates/Component.module.css` | Scoped CSS module — no global selectors |
| `templates/Component.test.tsx` | Testing Library sibling test |
| `templates/Component.stories.tsx` | Storybook sibling story with 3 variants |
| `templates/artefact.json` | Sample artefact metadata for validator |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-practices-frontend-components.py` | Validate output artefact against the JSON Schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml` | CI on each artefact change; pre-commit; agent self-check |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
