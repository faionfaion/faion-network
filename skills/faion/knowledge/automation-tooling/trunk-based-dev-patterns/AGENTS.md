# Trunk-Based Development Patterns

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a trunk-based pattern plan using feature flags, branch by abstraction, and dark launching — with cleanup tickets, positive flag naming, < 24h branch lifetimes, and < 1% dark-launch ramp before scaling.

**One-paragraph:** Trunk-based patterns at scale: feature flags hide incomplete work; branch by abstraction enables large refactors without long-lived branches; dark launching tests new implementations against production traffic before exposure. The methodology produces a pattern plan with: branch lifetime cap < 24h, one-flag-one-task with cleanup ticket at birth, positive flag naming (<area>.<verb>_<thing>), CI < 10 min, auto-revert on red trunk, dark-launch ramp < 1% for a full diurnal cycle, and explicit cleanup-collapse step for any BbA migration.

**Ефективно для:**

- Multi-step feature shipped on trunk with flag-gated rollout.
- Large refactor staged via Branch by Abstraction.
- Dark-launching a new implementation alongside the legacy one.
- Auditing existing flag inventory for cleanup obligations.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Team has a feature-flag provider (homegrown OK if reliable).
- Trunk-based gating (see trunk-based-ci-gates) is already in place.
- Project supports parallel implementations behind an interface (BbA candidate).
- Production observability exists (so dark-launch metrics can be compared).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Mobile/desktop release-cut projects without flag infrastructure.
- Solo project where 'shipping a small feature on trunk' has no audience to dark-launch against.
- Codebases where the CI gate is not yet trustworthy (apply trunk-based-ci-gates first).

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
