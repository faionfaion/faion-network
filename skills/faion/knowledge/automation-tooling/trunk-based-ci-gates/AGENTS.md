# Trunk-Based CI Gates

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a CI configuration enforcing trunk-based gates: pre-commit hooks under 1s, CI under 10 minutes, branch protection with full required-status list, auto-revert on red trunk, and a verifier that the required-status list stays in sync with CI job names.

**One-paragraph:** CI gates that keep trunk green: pre-commit hooks complete in <1s (lint + format + secret scan only — no pytest); CI is sub-10-minute (cache deps, parallelise tests, move slow integration suites to nightly); branch protection requires PR reviews + all CI status checks + linear history + restricts direct pushes; after any CI change, re-verify the required-status list via gh api so renamed/new jobs gate merges; auto-revert on red trunk via git revert -m 1 instead of human-managed reverts.

**Ефективно для:**

- New repo bootstrap needing the full CI gate set.
- Existing repo whose trunk breaks more than once per week (apply trunk-based-challenges first).
- Hardening branch protection after a hot-fix direct push incident.
- Aligning required-status list after adding/renaming CI jobs.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Hosting on GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket with branch protection API.
- Team has adopted trunk-based development.
- Tests can run in parallel (or be split into fast/slow tiers).
- Bot account or app available for auto-revert PRs.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Solo project with no CI yet (start with a single check first).
- Mobile/desktop release-branch projects (different gating model).
- Repos without admin access to configure branch protection.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
