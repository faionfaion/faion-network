# Puppeteer Launch & Navigation Setup

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a Puppeteer launch config + navigation wrapper with correct CI/Docker flags, pinned Chromium revision, finally-close discipline, and SPA-safe wait strategies.

**One-paragraph:** Puppeteer launch config is dominated by two failure modes: missing --no-sandbox in Docker/CI and over-using waitUntil='networkidle0' on SPAs. This methodology emits a launch wrapper with the safe flag set, PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR for read-only containers, a pinned Chromium revision in the lockfile, a try/finally to guarantee browser.close, and a goto helper that defaults to domcontentloaded + a targeted waitForSelector. The artefact is the config metadata; the validator checks the canonical fields are present.

**Ефективно для:**

- First-time Puppeteer setup in a Node.js worker.
- Migrating an existing script onto Puppeteer 22+ (waitForTimeout removed).
- Containerised CI runs needing --no-sandbox + dev-shm flags.
- Serverless deploy via @sparticuz/chromium with pinned revision.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Node.js worker driving Chromium via DevTools Protocol.
- Target environment is Docker, CI, or serverless (read-only filesystem).
- Need reproducible browser version across runs.
- Script runs as part of a larger pipeline (artifacts > exit code matter).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Cross-browser testing — use Playwright.
- Long-lived browser daemons fronted by an API (use puppeteer-session-management).
- Manual interactive debugging in a developer's machine without CI parity.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
