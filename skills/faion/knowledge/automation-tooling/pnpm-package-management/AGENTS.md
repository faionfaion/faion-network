# pnpm Package Management

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a pnpm-managed Node.js project config (.npmrc + pnpm-workspace.yaml + package.json packageManager pin + CI workflow) enforcing frozen lockfile, no shameful hoist, and only-allow pnpm.

**One-paragraph:** pnpm uses a content-addressable store and symlinked node_modules for strict dependency isolation. This methodology produces the config files that wire a project to pnpm correctly: .npmrc (strict-peer-dependencies, frozen-lockfile, engine-strict), pnpm-workspace.yaml (for monorepos), root package.json with a pinned packageManager field, a preinstall hook (only-allow pnpm) to block npm/yarn drift, and a CI workflow using pnpm/action-setup with store cache.

**Ефективно для:**

- All new Node.js/TypeScript projects unless org policy mandates npm/yarn.
- Monorepos with 3+ packages — pnpm workspaces are faster and first-class.
- CI pipelines where install time matters; pnpm + store cache shaves minutes.
- Projects with phantom-dependency bugs (imports work locally, fail in CI).

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- All new Node.js/TypeScript projects unless org policy requires npm/yarn.
- Monorepos with 3+ packages: pnpm workspaces are faster and first-class.
- CI pipelines where install time matters; pnpm + store cache shaves minutes.
- Projects with phantom-dependency bugs (imports work locally, fail elsewhere).
- Container builds wanting layer-cached deps via pnpm fetch.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- React Native projects pinned to npm/yarn by Metro/Expo (Expo SDK <= 50 had pnpm rough edges).
- One-file scripts where npm exec/bunx is lighter.
- Deploy targets with configs expecting package-lock.json that cannot be updated.
- Hosting platforms that refuse to honour the packageManager field.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Project root path + node_modules layout | directory | filesystem |
| Node.js >= 16.9 | binary on PATH | developer machine + CI |
| Target pnpm major version | semver string | team decision (default: latest LTS major) |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/npmrc` | Strict .npmrc — engine-strict, frozen lockfile, no shameful hoist |
| `templates/pnpm-workspace.yaml` | Workspace definition for apps/packages/tools layout |
| `templates/ci-pnpm.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow with pnpm store cache + frozen lockfile install |
| `templates/dockerfile-pnpm` | Multi-stage Dockerfile using pnpm fetch for layer caching |
| `templates/artefact.json` | Sample artefact metadata consumed by validator |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-pnpm-package-management.py` | Validate output artefact against the JSON Schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml` | CI on each artefact change; pre-commit; agent self-check |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, environment context, risk level) to a concrete conclusion, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which rule applies to the current context.
