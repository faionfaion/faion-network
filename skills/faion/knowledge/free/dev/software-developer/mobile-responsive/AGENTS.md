# Mobile-Responsive Web Design

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces mobile-first CSS (320px baseline up to 1920px) with viewport meta, fluid type via clamp(), CSS Grid layout, >=44x44px tap targets, no fixed pixel widths above 1px borders, and a multi-viewport Playwright verification step.

**One-paragraph:** Mobile-first CSS design: start at 320px and enhance for larger viewports via `min-width` media queries. Use relative units (rem, %, clamp()), CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout, viewport meta tag, and tap targets >= 44x44px (WCAG 2.5.5). On iOS use `100dvh`/`svh`/`lvh` instead of `100vh`. No hover-only interactions; provide touch equivalents. Verification: Playwright screenshots at 360/768/1280/1920, Lighthouse mobile perf > 85, axe-core a11y > 95.

**Ефективно для:** any public-facing web UI, audits after redesigns, Tailwind/Storybook component libraries, email/embed snippets, replacing desktop-first stylesheets that accumulated mobile override debt.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Web UI (HTML/CSS), not native mobile or print.
- Audience uses mobile devices (most public products).
- Build pipeline can run Playwright + Lighthouse in CI.
- Designs available or describable in mobile-first form.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Internal admin tool on fixed-resolution kiosk.
- Embedded WebView pinned to one viewport (Telegram WebApp).
- Print stylesheet / PDF generator.
- Native mobile (React Native / Flutter / SwiftUI) — different layout primitives.
