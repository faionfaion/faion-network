# Llamaindex Production Gotchas

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Hardens a LlamaIndex deployment (async loop, retriever concurrency, ReActAgent error handling, eval cost, callbacks) and emits a hardening-record.

**One-paragraph:** LlamaIndex has several non-obvious production failure modes: SubQuestionQueryEngine.query() blocks async loops, QueryFusionRetriever opens unbounded concurrent LLM calls, ReActAgent does not auto-recover from tool errors, and evaluation methods consume significant tokens. This methodology turns a deployment profile into a deterministic hardening-record patching each gotcha.

**Ефективно для:** solopreneur whose LlamaIndex bot worked in dev and now leaks money in prod.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Using LlamaIndex in production (or about to).
- App is async (FastAPI / asyncio).
- ≥1 of the known gotchas is in your stack (sub-question engine, fusion retriever, ReAct, eval).
- Cost or latency budget is bounded.
- Observability is wired (or about to be).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Notebook / not in production.
- Custom non-LlamaIndex stack — gotchas don't apply.
- App is fully sync (no async event loop to block).
- No tools, no eval — narrower hardening sufficies.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Branches on async (true → require aquery + non-blocking patches), then on components_used (subq → wrap; fusion → cap; react → try/except), then on cost cap. Each leaf cites a rule id in 01-core-rules.xml so the agent always cites which rule drove the choice — and can be replayed for audit.
