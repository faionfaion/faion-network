# Agent Customer-Zero Pilot Protocol

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a customer-zero pilot playbook: scope contract, success criteria with thresholds, kill switches, billing model, GA exit gate — for a single vertical agent.

**One-paragraph:** Customer-zero is the single highest-leverage moment for a vertical agent. Builders need a protocol covering pilot scope, success criteria, kill switches, billing, and exit-to-GA. No methodology covers this end-to-end today. This produces a 1-page playbook plus a 5-checkpoint checklist (week-1 scope, week-2 deploy, week-4 mid-pilot review, week-8 success-gate, week-12 GA exit or sunset).

**Ефективно для:** first paying customer for a new vertical agent; design partner programs; agencies running pilots for client agents.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Executing a customer-zero pilot for a new vertical agent
- All inputs reachable (people, data, artefacts)
- Output consumed by a named downstream owner with a deadline
- Deviations from the protocol are logged with rationale

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Highly contextual one-shot work where playbook constrains the wrong axes
- Pre-discovery — playbook assumes the problem is named
- Teams already running a well-tuned variant — re-tooling friction outweighs upside

## Decision tree

The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` filters whether agent-customer-zero-pilot-protocol applies: root question — "Is this a customer-zero pilot for a vertical agent?". Branches lead to a specific core rule (e.g., `rule:r1`) when the methodology fits, or to a `skip:` conclusion when it does not.
