# Agent Failure Taxonomy

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a shared agent-failure taxonomy: one primary label per incident from a closed vocabulary (hallucination / reasoning-shortfall / tool-misuse / context-overflow / injection / drift), each la...

**One-paragraph:** Without a shared vocabulary (hallucination vs reasoning-shortfall vs tool-misuse vs context-overflow vs injection vs drift) postmortems are ad-hoc and regression evals are not reusable across teams. P7's strategic-AI-narrative requires faion to own this taxonomy before competitors do. Output: labelled list, per-label remediation lane, append-only re-classification policy.

**Ефективно для:** incident triage, dashboard aggregation, regression-eval reusability across teams, executive reporting on agent quality.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- You triage incidents, issues, or failures and need a shared label set
- Labels feed dashboards or postmortems — consistent classification matters more than perfect labels
- Mis-classification cost (wrong remediation path) is bounded — labels are not safety-critical
- Taxonomy is versioned; new categories require explicit approval, not ad-hoc creation

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Failure modes still being discovered — premature labels lock in wrong categories
- Pre-incident exercises with no real data yet
- Single-incident retros where one-off detail matters more than aggregation

## Decision tree

The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` filters whether agent-failure-taxonomy applies: root question — "Are you triaging an agent incident or building label aggregation?". Branches lead to a specific core rule (e.g., `rule:r1`) when the methodology fits, or to a `skip:` conclusion when it does not.
