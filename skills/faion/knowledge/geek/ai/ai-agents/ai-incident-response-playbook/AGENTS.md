# AI Incident Response Playbook

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Operational runbook for AI-system incidents — explicit steps with signals, thresholds, kill-switch and rollback paths, escalation contacts at top, drilled within 90 days.

**One-paragraph:** Generic SRE runbooks miss AI-specific decision points: when to flip a kill-switch on the model, when to fall back to a deterministic rule, when to rollback to a prior bundle, when to throttle. This methodology produces one runbook per AI feature with structured steps (input signal, threshold, action, post-condition, time budget), escalation block at the top, and a drill-completion-date stamp. Output is committed in the ops repo alongside the incident-tracker links.

**Ефективно для:** Команд, які на incident читають runbook і знаходять «check if things look bad» — і потім втрачають 20 хвилин на догадки; методологія примушує писати «error_rate > 2% AND p95 latency > 3s → kill-switch step 5», і одна людина о 3-й ранку це виконує без думання.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- AI feature is in production with monitoring (error rate, latency, cost dashboards).
- A kill-switch or rollback mechanism exists in code (no runbook for non-revertible systems).
- On-call rotation exists with at least 2 engineers.
- Owner can schedule a drill within 90 days.
- Incident tracker (Linear / GitHub / PagerDuty) integrates with the runbook.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- No production AI traffic (pre-launch).
- No kill-switch / rollback path — runbook would have no actions to take.
- Single-engineer project where escalation block is meaningless.
- One-off batch job with no live users.

- peer: [[ai-incident-postmortem-template]] — runbook completion triggers postmortem.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Asks: (1) what is severity (sev-1/2/3)? (2) is the failure contained (single feature) or systemic? (3) is kill-switch sufficient or do we need rollback to prior bundle? Leaves point to the step path through the runbook.
