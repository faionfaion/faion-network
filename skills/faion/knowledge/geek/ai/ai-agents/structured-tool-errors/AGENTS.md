# Structured Tool Errors with recoveryHint

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Tool errors are part of the prompt — return a structured `{code, message, recoveryHint, traceId, …}` envelope so the agent loop can branch deterministically.

**One-paragraph:** Produces an error envelope returned by every tool error path with required fields `code` (UPPER_SNAKE), `message` (one human sentence, no stack trace), `recoveryHint` (closed enum `RETRY_LATER | CHECK_INPUT | TRY_ALTERNATIVE | REPORT_TO_USER | NEEDS_AUTH`), `traceId` (correlation ID), and optional `retry_after_seconds` + sanitised `details`. The closed-enum hint maps to one and only one runner action; the agent loop never re-interprets it. Studies (SHIELDA, Kumaran MCP error guide) report 30%+ reduction in dead-end retry loops vs free-form errors.

**Ефективно для:** будь-якого tool / MCP сервера, де агент в циклі retry-ить запити (rate-limits, auth, transient 5xx) і блукає в free-form error-повідомленнях замість дискретного "RETRY_LATER / CHECK_INPUT".

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Tool is invoked from an agent loop where the model may retry on its own.
- Tool wraps a flaky upstream (rate-limits, auth, transient 5xx) OR is an MCP server with a public error contract.
- The agent runner has (or will gain) a hint → action dispatcher.
- Errors are returned as JSON bodies the model can read.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Failures are genuinely unrecoverable AND the tool is invoked by deterministic code that never retries.
- Tool is invoked synchronously by a human user only (errors go to a UI, not a model loop).
- Tool emits warnings on a successful path; warnings belong in a separate `warnings: []` field, not the error envelope.

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Tool definition | JSON Schema / Anthropic tool spec / MCP manifest | tool source repo |
| Upstream failure taxonomy | enumerated list | runbook |
| Agent runner hint-dispatch map | YAML | `runner/policy.yml` |
| Existing error responses | sample HTTP bodies | logs / traces |

| Generate the OpenAPI / MCP error schema | sonnet | Schema translation, deterministic. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/error_envelope.json` | JSON Schema for the tool error envelope — copy into tool / MCP server contract. |
| `templates/recovery_hints.txt` | Closed enum of recovery hints with a one-line semantic for each value. |
| `templates/runner_policy.yaml` | YAML map from `recoveryHint` to runner action with retry budgets and timeouts. |

## Scripts

|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-structured-tool-errors.py` | Validates a sample tool-error JSON body against `02-output-contract.xml` / `error_envelope.json`. | Pre-commit hook on tool definitions; runtime smoke test in tool's test suite. |

- [[idempotent-write-tools]] — `RETRY_LATER` is only safe when the tool is idempotent.

## Decision tree

The tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` picks the `recoveryHint` value from the failure category: rate-limit / transient 5xx → `RETRY_LATER`; 4xx with bad arguments → `CHECK_INPUT`; auth missing/expired → `NEEDS_AUTH`; unrecoverable / 5xx with no retry budget → `REPORT_TO_USER`; resource missing but a peer tool exists → `TRY_ALTERNATIVE`. Use it whenever the question is "which hint do I emit for THIS failure".
