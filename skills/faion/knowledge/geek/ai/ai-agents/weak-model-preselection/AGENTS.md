# Weak-Model Preselection

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Run a cheap fast model to filter / classify / extract refs, then pass only the filtered slice to the expensive strong model.

**One-paragraph:** Strong models cost 5-30x per token. The expensive part of a hard task is reasoning over the right context, not finding the right context. A small model is usually plenty for tag / classify / rank / extract-refs tasks and can run on the full corpus to produce a 100x shorter input for the big model. This methodology codifies four cascade variants (filter-then-reason, reference-extract-then-load, classify-then-route, rank-then-rerank), the cost-savings audit format, and the safety rule that a weak filter never serves as sole gatekeeper for high-stakes decisions (medical / legal / security — use it as ranker only).

**Ефективно для:**

- RSS / news / log pipelines: cheap-model filter перед Opus reasoning — економія 60-90%.
- Long-doc QA: weak model extracts relevant passages → strong model reasons лише над виборкою.
- Multi-route applications: weak classifier → routes to a specialized strong-model prompt.
- Будь-який pipeline, де &gt; 70% input — це noise, який strong model не повинен бачити.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Input is long (&gt; 5K tokens) with high noise ratio (relevant content &lt; 30%).
- A cheap model exists for the filter task (classification / extraction / ranking).
- The strong-model step is the dominant cost in the pipeline.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Short inputs (&lt; 1K tokens) — routing overhead exceeds savings.
- High-stakes gates (medical / legal / security) where weak-model false negative is catastrophic.
- Tasks requiring full-context emergent insight (long-context literary analysis).

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, eval scores, stakes, noise ratio, etc.) to a concrete action, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which variant of the methodology to apply.
