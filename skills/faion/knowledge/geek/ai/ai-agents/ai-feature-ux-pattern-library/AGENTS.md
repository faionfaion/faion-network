# AI Feature UX Pattern Library

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Catalogue of UX patterns specific to AI features — confidence indicators, refusal surfaces, edit-the-output, "why did the model say this" trails, undo gates — selectable per feature with a one-page picker.

**One-paragraph:** Generic component libraries (buttons, modals, lists) don't cover the AI-specific UX choices that make or break user trust: how to surface confidence, what to render when the model refuses, how to give users editable hand-off, how to explain a prediction, how to undo an AI-generated action. This methodology catalogues seven core patterns, prescribes a per-feature picker (which patterns are mandatory, which are optional), and outputs one UX spec attached to the feature brief that designers can hand to engineering.

**Ефективно для:** Команд, де AI-фічі ходять у production з generic UX («Sure, here's your output») і потім скаржаться, що користувачі їм не довіряють; pattern library дає чек-лист — і Designer закриває гепи до релізу, не після першого incident.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- AI feature is user-facing (not a backend pipeline).
- A design owner exists for the feature.
- The feature has at least one of: model refusal, confidence variability, irreversible action.
- A component library / design system exists to extend.
- Feature is past pre-MVP — UX iteration is on the critical path.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Backend-only AI feature (no UI surface).
- Greenfield with no design system — establish one first.
- Single-user prototype where UX is intentionally rough.
- Feature is read-only deterministic (no refusal / no action / no confidence).

## Prerequisites

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Asks: (1) does the feature have user-facing UI surfaces? (2) is model refusal possible? (3) is the action irreversible? Leaves point to the mandatory pattern subset (confidence + refusal-surface + undo gate) plus optional adds.
