# Reasoning-First Architectures

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces an agent-architecture spec selecting ReAct, Tree-of-Thought, Reflexion, or Planning-Loop based on task complexity, branching needs, and budget.

**One-paragraph:** Agents that act without thinking produce hallucinated tool calls and brittle plans. Reasoning-first architectures (ReAct, ToT, Reflexion, Planning Loop) explicitly separate thinking from acting. This methodology picks the right one per drivers: complexity, branching, replan budget.

**Ефективно для:** team running agents that act too fast and fail at branching tasks; their traces show no thinking step.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Designing a new agent for complex multi-step tasks.
- Existing agents fail on branching or recovery from errors.
- Reasoning models (o1, claude-extended-thinking) are available.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Simple lookup or single-tool tasks.
- Latency-critical with <100ms budget.
- Closed deterministic workflows.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Walks the drivers and picks a rule id per leaf. Each conclusion cites a rule in 01-core-rules.xml so the spec records the audit chain.
