# Agent Drift Detection (Statistical)

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a statistical drift-detection spec: pass-rate control chart with CUSUM, KL divergence on output distributions, judge-score regression with confidence intervals — gates production decisions...

**One-paragraph:** Eval scores drift across model upgrades, retrieval-index updates, prompt edits. No methodology defines the statistical machinery: per-eval pass-rate control charts, KL-divergence on output distributions, judge-score regression with confidence intervals. Without it P7 ships and prays. This produces the detector spec + alert thresholds + a re-test policy keyed to drift severity.

**Ефективно для:** production agents with daily eval runs; teams making deploy/rollback/freeze decisions on numeric evidence; pre-GA agents stabilizing across model upgrades.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- You are stabilizing or comparing AI feature behavior across model, prompt, or retrieval versions
- A ground-truth set ≥30 examples exists OR can be assembled in one work-cycle
- Eval results gate at least one production decision (deploy, rollback, freeze)
- Cost ceiling per eval run is defined before the first run

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Pre-MVP exploration where output quality is judged by founders eyeballing
- Features so niche that authoring a ground-truth set takes longer than 3 sprints
- Cost-prohibitive evals when cheaper proxies (regression of intermediate metric) cover risk

## Decision tree

The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` filters whether agent-drift-detection-statistical applies: root question — "Does the team gate prod decisions on eval scores?". Branches lead to a specific core rule (e.g., `rule:r1`) when the methodology fits, or to a `skip:` conclusion when it does not.
