# Agent Shape Decision Frame

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Playbook that frames "what shape of agent do we build" — single-turn, multi-turn, single-agent, multi-agent, hosted vs custom — into a step-by-step decision with named exit criteria, branches, and owner.

**One-paragraph:** Teams often start building an agent by picking a framework (LangChain, CrewAI, Claude Agent SDK) before deciding what shape the agent should be. This playbook reverses the order: it walks an operator through five framing questions (turn count, agent count, tool surface, deployment surface, evaluation surface), produces a structured decision record naming the chosen shape and the rejected shapes with reasons, and hands that off to architecture for framework selection. Output is one decision record per agent feature.

**Ефективно для:** Команд, які тиждень обговорюють «давайте multi-agent» без чітких критеріїв; playbook за дві години дає документований вибір форми, де кожна гілка має сигнал і відповідального — і його можна показати CTO без переробки.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- New agent feature is being scoped (no shape committed yet).
- At least two candidate shapes are plausible (otherwise the decision is trivial).
- A named architecture owner can sign off on the final shape.
- Token budget for the feature has at least a rough ceiling.
- Evaluation strategy is open — not pre-locked by an existing harness.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Shape is already implemented and shipped — use a refactor playbook instead.
- Feature is so narrow that a single tool call solves it (no agent needed).
- Team has < 2 weeks of agent experience — pick the smallest shape (single-turn single-agent) without ceremony.
- Decision has been made by leadership for reasons outside this frame.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Asks five framing questions in order: turn count, agent count, tool surface size, deployment surface (hosted / custom), eval surface availability. Leaves point to one of: single-turn-single-agent, multi-turn-single-agent, multi-agent, hosted-only (use Claude Code headless), or escalate-to-research.
