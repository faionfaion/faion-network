# Progressive Disclosure Skills

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a skill-design spec authoring Claude Skills as a 3-level pyramid: frontmatter always-loaded, body on activation, references on explicit Read.

**One-paragraph:** Claude Skills auto-load frontmatter into context; body loads on keyword match; references load only on explicit Read. Designing skills as a 3-level pyramid defers context cost. This methodology emits a spec: frontmatter keyword set, body length target, reference layout.

**Ефективно для:** Claude Code user whose plugin scope is exploding because every skill body is 2K+ tokens.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Authoring Claude Code skills (SKILL.md format).
- Plugin scope exceeds 20K tokens always-loaded.
- Skills have content that not every invocation needs.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Single-tool skill with <500 tokens.
- Custom CLI commands (not skills).
- Throwaway prototype.

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `skill-inventory.yaml` | list of {name, frontmatter_tokens, body_tokens, ref_count} | operator |
| `max_session_tokens` | integer | ops |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|---|---|
| none | Self-contained. |

## Content (load on demand)

| File | Depth | What's inside | Est. tokens |

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Walks the drivers and picks a rule id per leaf. Each conclusion cites a rule in 01-core-rules.xml so the spec records the audit chain.
