# Context Bleed Detection Recipe

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a runnable detection recipe (canary probe + embedding-distance check + tag-based audit) for context bleed across multi-tenant LLM sessions, plus a tagged incident record for each hit.

**Ефективно для:** Production LLM systems that serve multiple tenants from the same model deployment where a user can ask a benign question and recover snippets from a prior user's session, OR where stale tool output from turn N-1 silently feeds into turn N.

**One-paragraph:** Pins the recurring "is this LLM bleeding context between sessions" investigation into a deterministic recipe. The recipe injects per-session canary tokens, snapshots system-prompt + tool-call state, and runs a post-hoc embedding-distance check between adjacent sessions. Output is a tagged incident record naming (a) the bleed type (cross-tenant / prior-turn / system-drift), (b) the probe that fired, (c) the affected session ids, and (d) the recommended kill switch (session-id reset, fresh worker, prompt-cache invalidate).

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- LLM serves at least two distinct tenants OR sessions from the same model deployment.
- A bleed-like complaint or audit finding has been opened in the last 30 days.
- The operator has session logs + system-prompt history available.
- Tier == geek or higher.
- A single accountable on-call owner can be named.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Single-tenant / single-session deployment with no carry-over surface.
- Bleed already root-caused and patched — use a regression test, not this recipe.
- Provider-managed deployment where session isolation is delegated (e.g., managed agent runtime) — open vendor ticket instead.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Three-question tree: (1) preconditions present? - no = skip; yes (2) canary appeared in foreign session? - yes = cross-tenant bleed; no (3) embedding-distance between turn N and N-1 across sessions exceeds threshold? - yes = prior-turn carry-over; no = clean. Terminal branches reference rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
