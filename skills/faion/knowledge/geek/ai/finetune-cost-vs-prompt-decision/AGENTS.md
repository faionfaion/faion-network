# Fine-tune Cost vs Prompt Decision

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a one-page decision record (problem type, data volume, eval lift bar, $/inference target) that blocks bad fine-tune calls and routes the team to prompt + RAG + routing when the math says so.

**One-paragraph:** Teams over-reach for fine-tuning because the cost story is opaque. This methodology forces a one-page artefact with four numbers (training cost, hosting/inference $/k tokens, eval lift % vs prompt baseline, break-even volume) and a single recommendation: fine-tune, prompt-improve, RAG, route, or hybrid. The frame is intentionally narrow — engineers either justify with numbers or pick a cheaper path.

**Ефективно для:** ml-engineer kickoff gate, p7-llm-agent-developer cost reviews, FinOps challenges, RFC reviewers blocking ill-justified training spend, founders deciding the AI roadmap.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- A team is seriously considering fine-tuning a model for a production workload.
- A baseline (prompt-only) eval result exists for the workload.
- Inference volume (req/day) and unit cost ($/k tokens) for current provider are known.
- A named decision owner (eng manager or staff) will sign the record.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- No baseline eval — build evals before debating fine-tune.
- Research/exploration only, no production constraint — methodology overhead does not pay back.
- Compliance forces on-prem fine-tune — decision is pre-made.

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline eval score | float in [0,1] | eval harness |
| Daily request volume | int | analytics |
| Current $/k tokens | float | provider invoice |
| Candidate training set size | int (examples) | data lake |
| Lift bar (min Δscore to justify) | float in [0,1] | product owner |

## Decision tree

The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes: eval lift ≥ bar AND break-even ≤ 12 months AND data ≥ minimum → fine-tune; else prompt+RAG+routing; else skip.
