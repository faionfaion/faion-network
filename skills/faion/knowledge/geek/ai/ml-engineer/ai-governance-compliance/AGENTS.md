# AI Governance and Compliance

## Summary

**One-sentence:** EU AI Act + NIST AI RMF aligned governance bundle: risk tier, model card, datasheet, fairness/explainability audit, audit trail, human-oversight plan, retention policy.

**One-paragraph:** Operationalises AI governance into seven concrete artefacts an agent must produce before shipping a production model: (1) risk tier per EU AI Act, (2) model card, (3) datasheet, (4) fairness + explainability audit, (5) immutable audit trail, (6) human-oversight plan, (7) data-retention policy with right-to-deletion path. Each artefact has a template, a verifier, and a named approver.

**Ефективно для:** ML eng + legal-counterpart, що шиплять модель з EU-експозицією і не хочуть платити 35M EUR штрафу, бо «не задокументували».

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- model lands in production with real users
- any user is in the EU OR model decides about people (credit, hiring, healthcare)
- PII is processed by training or inference
- regulatory exposure (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001) is in scope
- a Designated Responsible Individual (DRI) exists

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- proof-of-concept with no production traffic
- minimal-risk model (spam filter, recommender without legal impact)
- pre-revenue startup with no EU exposure (yet)
- no DRI assigned — governance without ownership is theatre

## Decision tree

The mandatory tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` picks the right rule branch for the current task. Branches use observable inputs (numeric / boolean / categorical) and every leaf cites one of `r1-risk-tier-first`, `r2-named-dri`, `r3-audit-trail-immutable`, `r4-fairness-explainability`, `r5-human-oversight` from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
