# AI Agent Patterns

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Six agentic AI patterns (ReAct, CoT, Tool Use, Plan-Execute, Reflection, Tree-of-Thoughts) + four multi-agent topologies. Decision record picking the right pattern.

**One-paragraph:** Catalogues six structured patterns for agentic AI systems plus multi-agent coordination topologies (Sequential, Parallel, Supervisor, Hierarchical). The methodology output is a decision record naming the chosen pattern + the 2 axes that drove the choice (loop shape, multi-agent need) + the rejected alternatives.

**Ефективно для:** Architects + tech leads, що уникають «давайте візьмемо ReAct, тому що всі беруть» через структурний вибір по двох осях.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- new agent project at scoping stage
- task shape is at least partially known (single vs multi-step, single vs multi-agent)
- you have ≥1 candidate framework selected
- decision-record discipline is in scope
- team can revisit the choice in 3 months

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- task is trivially single-shot — no agent pattern needed
- framework mandates a single pattern (e.g., CrewAI = role-based) — work within it
- research / exploratory phase — try patterns; decision record later
- patterns already decided by org policy

| `plan-step` | sonnet | Standard reasoning over the procedure / scoring axes. |
| `author-output` | sonnet | Produces the artefact in the shape `produces=decision-record`. |
| `audit-validate` | haiku | Mechanical schema check via `scripts/validate-ai-agent-patterns.py`. |
| `senior-review` | opus | Cross-artefact judgement on rejection / approval. |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-ai-agent-patterns.py` | Validate an output artefact against the JSON schema from `content/02-output-contract.xml`. | Pre-merge on the artefact PR + `--self-test` in CI. |

## Decision tree

The mandatory tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` picks the right rule branch for the current task. Branches use observable inputs (numeric / boolean / categorical) and every leaf cites one of `r1-two-axes`, `r2-default-react`, `r3-plan-execute-when-long`, `r4-reflection-when-self-correct`, `r5-multi-agent-when-roles` from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
