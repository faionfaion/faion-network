# Router / Tuned-Model Shadow Deploy Protocol

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Shadow-deploy protocol for LLM routers and tuned-model cascades — mirror live traffic to a candidate router, compute per-request scoring delta vs production, enforce schema parity + cost guardrail, gate promotion on a paired offline+online metric.

**One-paragraph:** Generic A/B testing methodology does not cover the specific risks of deploying a router (one that picks between models) or a tuned model running in shadow behind a stronger model. Routers introduce three failure modes that A/B does not catch: cost spike (the cheap router routes unexpectedly to the expensive model), scoring delta (the cheap model output is plausible but wrong in subtle ways), and schema mismatch (the new router returns slightly different JSON keys). This methodology pins the shadow protocol: mirror 100% of traffic to the candidate router, do NOT return its output to users, log scoring delta + cost delta + schema-parity at the request level, gate promotion only after ≥7-day stable window where (a) scoring delta within acceptance contract, (b) cost ≤ baseline × 1.1, (c) schema parity = 100%. Mechanism: shadow window → metric review → gradual percentage rollout → full cut-over with rollback ready. Primary output: a `shadow-report.yaml` and a go/no-go decision artefact.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- production LLM system with a router OR cascade (multiple models, dynamic selection)
- candidate change is a new router, new routing policy, or a tuned model that would replace one of the cascade legs
- traffic mirror infrastructure available (in the gateway, sidecar, or app code)
- acceptance contract exists or is in scope (`geek/ai/ml-engineer/rag-feature-acceptance-contract`)
- finance / budget signoff for the shadow window's mirrored cost (mirror doubles inference cost for the shadow duration)

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- single-model setup with no router — use standard model-upgrade methodology
- shadow window cost exceeds available budget — run a sample-only shadow (≤10% traffic) instead
- candidate router cannot be deployed without serving traffic (no separate code path) — fix the architecture first
- no scoring mechanism available (no judge, no offline metric) — build it first; shadow without scoring is noise

## Prerequisites

- candidate router or tuned model containerised + reachable from the gateway
- per-request judge or rubric callable (LLM-judge, fixed-eval scorer, or production user-signal proxy)
- baseline cost-per-1k-requests from current router
- schema spec for the response (JSON schema or Pydantic model)
- rollback path documented (feature flag off, gateway config revert)
