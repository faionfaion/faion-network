# Eval Set Stratified Sampling Recipe

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a stratified sampling recipe (per-cohort × per-tool × per-intent quotas) for daily LLM eval-set drift checks so the slice is representative without paying full-eval cost.

**One-paragraph:** Daily drift checks cannot run the full eval set — too slow, too expensive. A naive random subsample misses tails (low-volume intents, new cohorts, rare tools). This methodology produces a written sampling recipe: declared strata (cohort × tool × intent × difficulty), per-stratum quota (proportional-with-floor, never raw-proportional), seed-locked sampler, fixed daily N, and a drift comparator that triggers re-sample only when the prod traffic distribution shifts >10%. Output is a `sampling-recipe.json` that the eval harness reads each morning.

**Ефективно для:** daily eval-suite triage, p7-llm-agent-developer drift monitoring, ML-ops on-call who needs a fixed-cost slice that still covers the long tail, teams whose eval bill 10x'd after they added cohorts.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Production LLM workload has ≥3 named cohorts, tools, or intents.
- A full eval set ≥500 cases exists and is too expensive to run daily.
- Traffic distribution per stratum is known (analytics or trace logs).
- A daily slice budget (cases-per-day or $/day) is fixed.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Full eval set ≤500 cases — run it whole, sampling adds noise without saving money.
- No traffic distribution data — fix observability before designing strata.
- Single cohort/intent — random subsample is equivalent, no stratification needed.

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Eval set manifest | JSONL with `cohort`, `tool`, `intent`, `difficulty` fields | eval repo |
| Production traffic distribution | CSV `stratum,count_30d,share_pct` | analytics warehouse |
| Daily slice budget | int (cases/day) or float ($/day with $/case rate) | finops / on-call lead |
| Prior recipe (if exists) | `sampling-recipe.json` | eval repo `eval/` dir |

## Decision tree

The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` filters: eval-set size ≥500, multi-stratum, traffic data available, then chooses between fresh-recipe or carry-forward branches based on traffic drift vs prior recipe.
