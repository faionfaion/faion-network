# Training Data Sourcing Policy

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a versioned training-data-sourcing policy: allowed sources, prohibited classes, licence + consent gating, PII handling, audit trail and approval owners for fine-tuning runs.

**Ефективно для:** ML engineers preparing a fine-tune corpus; data leads gating customer-data usage for training; legal / compliance reviewers on AI training pipelines.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "training-data-sourcing-policy" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Team is fine-tuning OR pre-training on data not provided by the foundation-model vendor.
- Data includes user content (PII or customer corpus).
- Regulatory regime applies (GDPR / CCPA / HIPAA / EU AI Act).
- Owner exists to sign the policy.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Team is prompt-only (no fine-tuning) — pivot to prompt-data policy.
- Corpus is fully public-domain with no PII — overhead unjustified.
- Vendor handles all training; team only operates inference.

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Corpus inventory | CSV / Parquet manifest | data engineering |
| Source licence table | CSV / Markdown | legal |
| Consent register | CSV / DB extract | trust + safety |
| PII classifier output | JSONL | data engineering |
| Policy owner + approver | handle / email | team roster |

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
