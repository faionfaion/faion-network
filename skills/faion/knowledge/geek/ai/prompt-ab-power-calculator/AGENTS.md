# Prompt A/B Power Calculator

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Computes per-arm sample sizes and significance thresholds for weekly prompt-version A/B reviews so solo agent builders stop running under-powered tests.

**One-paragraph:** Solo prompt iterators chronically under-power their A/Bs — they ship a variant after 12 traffic samples and call the regression a "model drift". This methodology produces a `power-calc-spec.json` artefact pinning baseline rate, MDE (minimum detectable effect), alpha, target power, and computed per-arm n. Downstream A/B harness consumes the spec; the calculator refuses to run under-powered configurations.

**Ефективно для:**

- Weekly prompt-version A/B review (recurring cadence).
- Solo agent builders, що pushуть variants without power calculation.
- Малий або середній traffic — точно знати, скільки треба зібрати.
- Bridge between prompt-engineering and rag-eval-ab-testing.
- Audit trail: spec versioned + owned + reviewed.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Recurring A/B review on the operating cadence.
- Baseline metric defined and measurable.
- Named accountable owner.
- Repository / wiki hosts the versioned spec.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- One-shot prompt change without recurrence.
- No baseline metric defined yet — block on baseline definition first.
- Fewer than 3 instances per year.
- No named owner.

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline rate (current variant) | float ∈ [0,1] | eval harness |
| Minimum detectable effect (MDE) | float | product target |
| Alpha (significance) | float ∈ (0,0.5) | stats policy |
| Target power | float ∈ (0.5,0.99) | stats policy |
| Traffic per day | int | analytics |
| Named accountable owner | string | ownership log |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree routes to the calculator if baseline rate and MDE are pinned; refuses if traffic-per-day cannot reach the computed n within the review cadence. Walk it before scheduling the A/B; running an under-powered test wastes the cadence slot.
