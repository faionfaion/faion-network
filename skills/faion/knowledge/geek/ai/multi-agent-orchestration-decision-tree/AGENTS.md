# Multi-Agent Orchestration Decision Tree

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a multi-agent orchestration decision record — topology pick, hand-off protocol, judge-actor justification, measurable rollback trigger.

**One-paragraph:** Multi-agent systems are popular and almost always wrong by default. This methodology produces a typed decision record naming: the topology (single+tools / hierarchical / collaborative / conversational), the hand-off protocol (task_id + scoped context + success criteria + escalation), whether a judge-actor split is empirically justified (quality_lift_pp ≥ 2 at acceptable cost_multiplier), and a rollback trigger (latency, cost, quality vs single-agent baseline). Without this, teams ship multi-agent for "separation of concerns" and pay 30-100% extra latency for no measurable quality lift.

**Ефективно для:** ML-engineer, що дебатує "agent vs orchestrator" і хоче явну, ревьюваємо decision з measurable rollback — а не фанбойство.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Considering splitting a single-agent + tools setup into multiple agents.
- A current baseline (single-agent + tools) exists or can be reconstructed.
- An eval that can measure quality lift at the relevant task is available.
- A named owner can run the periodic re-evaluation.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Single-task workflow with no hand-off — multi-agent adds overhead for zero gain.
- Prototype where neither quality nor cost has been measured yet — build single-agent first.
- Regulatory / compliance overrides force a specific topology.

## Decision tree

The tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` triages: is single-agent + tools the baseline? → measure quality lift at the proposed multi-agent topology → adopt only if lift_pp ≥ 2 AND cost_multiplier within budget. Walk it before refactoring a working single-agent into a multi-agent debate club.
