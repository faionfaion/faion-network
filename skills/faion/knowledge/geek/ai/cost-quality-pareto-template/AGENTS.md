# Cost-Quality Pareto Template

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a Pareto-frontier report (cost-x, quality-y, per-model dots, dominated points, recommended sweet-spot) for an AI feature choosing between models or prompt variants.

**Ефективно для:** Engineering leads holding the model-choice review where 4-6 candidate model/prompt combos exist and the team is debating in slack instead of looking at the same Pareto chart.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "cost-quality pareto template" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a single accountable owner is named; the decision tree routes preconditions to a run/skip outcome. Source material grounded in: ParetoBandit / Beyond the Pareto Frontier (Cognaptus 2026).

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Task is an instance of the recurring "cost-quality pareto template" decision OR a closely-adjacent variant.
- Operator has the artefacts named in Prerequisites available before starting.
- Output will be consumed by a downstream agent, gate, or named human reviewer.
- A single accountable owner can be named.
- Tier == geek or higher.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Team already maintains a working artefact for this gap — replace, do not duplicate.
- Single-use throwaway task — overhead of the contract is not justified.
- Regulatory regime mandates a vendor governance platform — defer to vendor flow.
- Greenfield prototype with no production users yet.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |

| Last 30 days of context for the recurring "cost-quality pareto template" task | text / logs | system of record |
| Write access to the artefact store (repo / wiki / decision log) | repo path | repo admin |
| Named owner accountable for the output downstream | handle / email | team roster |
| Baseline conventions (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / CONVENTIONS.md) | md | code repo |

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question tree: (1) preconditions present? - no = skip; yes (2) variant detected per topic-specific signal? - routes to the appropriate produced variant. Terminal branches reference rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
