# Cost-Quality Tradeoff Framework

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a tradeoff framework spec naming the cost axis ($/task), quality axis (per-feature rubric), tolerance windows, and the SLO that anchors model-routing decisions.

**Ефективно для:** Platform team standardising how every feature in the org makes cost-quality decisions — turning ad-hoc model swaps into a versioned framework with clear SLO bands and named owners.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "cost-quality tradeoff framework" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a single accountable owner is named; the decision tree routes preconditions to a run/skip outcome. Source material grounded in: Economic Evaluation of LLMs (arxiv 2507.03834).

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Task is an instance of the recurring "cost-quality tradeoff framework" decision OR a closely-adjacent variant.
- Operator has the artefacts named in Prerequisites available before starting.
- Output will be consumed by a downstream agent, gate, or named human reviewer.
- A single accountable owner can be named.
- Tier == geek or higher.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Team already maintains a working artefact for this gap — replace, do not duplicate.
- Single-use throwaway task — overhead of the contract is not justified.
- Regulatory regime mandates a vendor governance platform — defer to vendor flow.
- Greenfield prototype with no production users yet.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question tree: (1) preconditions present? - no = skip; yes (2) variant detected per topic-specific signal? - routes to the appropriate produced variant. Terminal branches reference rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
