# Fine-tune vs Prompt+RAG Decision Tree

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces an opinionated decision-record on WHEN fine-tune beats prompt + RAG + routing on the four axes (quality, cost, latency, maintenance), with revisit triggers, so engineers stop over-fine-tuning.

**One-paragraph:** Faion ships fine-tuning-openai-* (HOW) and lora-qlora (HOW). What is missing is the opinionated WHEN: a tree that, given quality gap, cost target, latency target, and ops budget, returns one of {prompt-improve, RAG, route, fine-tune, hybrid}. This methodology produces a one-page artefact with the four axis scores, the tree's decision, and the named revisit triggers (volume jumps 3x, new model ships at -50% price, eval drift). Sister to `[[finetune-cost-vs-prompt-decision]]` (numbers-first); this one is the decision graph.

**Ефективно для:** RFC review of any "let's fine-tune X" proposal, ml-engineer triage, CTO checkpoint before training spend, FinOps challenges, post-mortem after a fine-tune flop.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Production workload has a measurable eval (score in [0,1]).
- Cost, quality, OR latency is below the product's target.
- A list of alternatives tried (better prompt, RAG, routing, distillation) exists OR will be filled.
- Owner is a named human, not a team alias.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- No eval set — build evals first.
- Compliance forces on-prem FT — decision is pre-made, document it instead.
- Research/exploration with no production users — methodology does not pay back.

## Decision tree

The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` runs four axis checks: if 0 axes failing → no change; if quality alone → prompt-improve; if cost + latency → routing/distillation; if all four → fine-tune.
