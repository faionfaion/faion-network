# Auto Rollback Policy Design

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Quality-score-based auto-rollback policy for AI features: thresholds + window + traffic ratio + manual override; replaces ad-hoc on-call decisions with a deterministic config.

**One-paragraph:** Model swaps and prompt updates are deployed under on-call pressure with ad-hoc rollback decisions. This methodology specifies a quality-score-based auto-rollback policy: per-axis thresholds (outcome / trajectory / resources), time window for rolling average, traffic-ratio gate for canary, manual override path, and a post-rollback runbook. Output is a YAML config consumed by the deploy pipeline + alerting wire; CI validates the config against the schema on every PR. Replaces fire-drill rollbacks with measurable, debate-free decisions.

**Ефективно для:**

- Model migration (4.5 → 4.6 / 4.7) — auto-rollback ловить regressions без on-call судження.
- Prompt swap у production: канарковий ratio + auto-rollback при quality drop &gt; 5pp.
- RAG chunking changes — quality-score gate видаляє debate з deploy decision.
- ML-ops команди, які хочуть SLO-style guarantees на AI feature reliability.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- AI feature has measurable quality score (eval rubric from trajectory-eval-otel or ai-feature-eval-set-design).
- Deploy pipeline supports canary or traffic-shift rollout.
- On-call team is the bottleneck during rollouts (ad-hoc rollback decisions take &gt; 30 min).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Quality score is unmeasurable in real-time (no scoring pipeline within 10 min of inference).
- Single-tenant on-prem deploy where rollback is a manual restart.
- Experimental / pre-launch features where rollback semantics don't apply yet.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |

| Quality-score pipeline | function: trace → score (0-1) | from trajectory-eval-otel or feature-eval |
| Deploy pipeline | canary / traffic-shift support | infra |
| Baseline score | JSON with score per axis | first eval run |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, eval scores, stakes, noise ratio, etc.) to a concrete action, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which variant of the methodology to apply.
