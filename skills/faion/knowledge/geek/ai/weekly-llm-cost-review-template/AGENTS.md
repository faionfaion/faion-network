# Weekly LLM Cost Review Template

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a weekly LLM cost + token-budget review report: spend by surface / model / provider, top drivers, deviation from forecast, action items with owners and due-dates.

**Ефективно для:** ML engineers + finance running a weekly LLM spend review; PMs tracking model-cost-to-revenue ratio; FinOps embedding LLM into the cloud-cost cadence.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "weekly-llm-cost-review-template" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Team has ≥3 weeks of LLM cost telemetry segmented by surface + model.
- Weekly cadence exists or is being introduced.
- Owner exists for cost decisions.
- Forecast (target or budget) exists or is being introduced.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Team has <2 weeks of telemetry — bootstrap that first.
- Spend below review-overhead threshold (<$500/mo).
- Single-tenant prototype with no production traffic.

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Weekly cost telemetry (last 4 weeks) | CSV / Parquet | FinOps |
| Surface / model / provider taxonomy | Markdown | platform |
| Forecast / budget | spreadsheet | finance |
| Owner for action items | handle / email | team roster |
| Previous week's action-item log | Markdown | review owner |

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
