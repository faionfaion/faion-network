# Junior AI Co-Pilot Curriculum

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a 6-week onboarding curriculum that brings a junior engineer to safe-and-useful daily AI co-pilot usage — modules, exercises, gating rubric, mentor checklist.

**One-paragraph:** Juniors thrown at AI co-pilots either over-trust (commit hallucinated APIs that fail in prod) or under-trust (still write everything by hand, lose the productivity edge). A 6-week curriculum with explicit modules — prompt anatomy, hallucination check, scoped edits, test-first AI, security boundaries, mentor review — paired with weekly exercises and a gating rubric (junior cannot graduate to unsupervised co-pilot use without passing all rubric items) turns AI usage into a learned skill rather than a folklore practice. Mentor checklist makes review consistent across teams.

**Ефективно для:** dev teams onboarding 1-5 juniors per quarter, agencies standardising AI usage across consultants, bootcamps adding AI module to existing curriculum.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- At least one junior engineer (≤2 years professional experience) joins the team in the next quarter.
- The team has settled on a primary AI co-pilot (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) — curriculum mentions tool specifics.
- A named mentor with ≥1 year of AI-augmented dev experience exists.
- A safe sandbox / staging environment is available for junior exercises.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Solo founder with no juniors — content overhead with no audience.
- Team has no AI co-pilot in use — curriculum has nothing to anchor on.
- Junior already passed an equivalent program at prior employer — sit-the-rubric instead of repeat the curriculum.

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Tech stack | inventory | engineering wiki |
| Primary AI co-pilot tool name | string | team standard |
| Codebase access (read + sandbox write) | git creds | onboarding script |
| Mentor calendar slot | weekly 30-min | mentor's calendar |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|---|---|
| `[[ai-failure-mode-taxonomy]]` | Junior must recognise the 6 base failure modes. |
| `[[indirect-prompt-injection-defense]]` | Security module references this directly. |

## Content (load on demand)

| File | Depth | What's inside | Est. tokens |
|---|---|---|---|
| `content/01-core-rules.xml` | essential | 6 testable rules: 6-week schedule, ≥6 modules, weekly exercise, mentor 30-min review, gating rubric, no-grad-without-pass | ~700 |
| `content/02-output-contract.xml` | essential | JSON Schema for curriculum.json: modules, exercises, rubric, mentor checklist | ~600 |
| `content/03-failure-modes.xml` | essential | 5 antipatterns: vibes-only training, no rubric, no mentor, single-tool tunnel, no security module | ~600 |
| `content/04-procedure.xml` | medium | 6-step procedure: assess junior → tailor modules → assign exercises → review weekly → score rubric → graduate | ~800 |
| `content/06-decision-tree.xml` | essential | Root: "is there an incoming junior + AI co-pilot in the team?" | ~400 |

## Task Routing

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Tailor module list to stack | sonnet | Mechanical from tech-stack inventory. |
| Generate exercises | opus | Creative + level-appropriate. |
| Score rubric attempt | sonnet | Bounded comparison against rubric. |
| Author mentor talking points | sonnet | Template-filled. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `templates/curriculum.schema.json` | JSON Schema for curriculum.json. |
| `templates/curriculum-skeleton.md` | 6-week skeleton with module headers. |
| `templates/rubric.md` | Gating rubric (binary pass/fail per item). |
| `templates/mentor-checklist.md` | Weekly review checklist for mentors. |
| `templates/_smoke-test.json` | Minimum curriculum.json that passes the validator. |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/validate-junior-ai-co-pilot-curriculum.py` | Validates curriculum.json against the schema; asserts ≥6 modules, ≥1 exercise per module, rubric with ≥10 items. | Pre-commit on curriculum; before sharing with new hires. |

## Decision tree

The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` gates whether to spin up the curriculum: no incoming junior or no co-pilot in use → skip; junior incoming and tool standardised → run the protocol; junior with prior pass certificate → run rubric only.
