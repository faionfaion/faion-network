# Drift SLO Thresholds Cookbook

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a cookbook of drift-SLO threshold configs per use case: input-distance, output-quality-delta, refusal-rate, alert hysteresis, and rollback trigger.

**Ефективно для:** Teams running drift monitors but using guessed thresholds — false alarms drown the real signal. The cookbook gives per-class anchors that survive review.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "drift slo thresholds cookbook" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a single accountable owner is named; the decision tree routes preconditions to a run/skip outcome. Source material grounded in: Stack Pulsar LLM Model Drift Detection 2026.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Task is an instance of the recurring "drift slo thresholds cookbook" decision OR a closely-adjacent variant.
- Operator has the artefacts named in Prerequisites available before starting.
- Output will be consumed by a downstream agent, gate, or named human reviewer.
- A single accountable owner can be named.
- Tier == geek or higher.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Team already maintains a working artefact for this gap — replace, do not duplicate.
- Single-use throwaway task — overhead of the contract is not justified.
- Regulatory regime mandates a vendor governance platform — defer to vendor flow.
- Greenfield prototype with no production users yet.

## Prerequisites

| Named owner accountable for the output downstream | handle / email | team roster |
| Baseline conventions (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / CONVENTIONS.md) | md | code repo |

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question tree: (1) preconditions present? - no = skip; yes (2) variant detected per topic-specific signal? - routes to the appropriate produced variant. Terminal branches reference rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
