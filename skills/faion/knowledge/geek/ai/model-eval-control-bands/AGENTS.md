# Model Eval Control Bands

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a versioned Model Eval Control Bands artefact — typed inputs + named owner + decisions traceable to source artefacts + last_reviewed gate.

**One-paragraph:** Eval methodologies define metrics but rarely how to set + maintain control bands so drift is detectable without false alarms. This methodology turns "Daily eval-suite run + drift triage" into a typed artefact: per-metric upper/lower bounds, an alerting policy, a named accountable owner, a rationale citing the input distributions and historical variance that justified the bounds, and a `last_reviewed` field that flags stale records on read. Every decision in the output cites the input artefact that justified it; batching multiple unrelated decisions through one pass is rejected.

**Ефективно для:** ML-engineer, що тримає daily eval-suite + drift triage і потребує зрозумілих, ревьюваних control bands замість туманних "anything off" alerts.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Task is an instance of `role-ml-engineer/Daily eval-suite run + drift triage` or a near variant.
- All artefacts named in Prerequisites are available before starting.
- Output will be consumed by a downstream agent or human reviewer.
- Tier == geek.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Team already maintains a working artefact for this gap — replace, do not duplicate.
- Greenfield prototype with no production users.
- Regulatory / compliance overrides in-methodology guidance.

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Eval-suite metric definitions | YAML | eval repo |
| Historical metric series (≥30 days) | CSV / Parquet | observability |
| Owner registry | dir or doc | team handbook |
| Last-rotation policy | doc | governance |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|---|---|
| `geek/ai/ml-engineer/model-evaluation` | Defines the metrics this bands. |
| `geek/ai/ml-engineer/llm-observability-stack` | Source of the historical series. |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/validate-model-eval-control-bands.py` | Enforce output contract: artefact_id, owner non-plural, rationale references inputs, version + last_reviewed present. | After subagent return, before consumer reads. |

## Decision tree

The tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` triages: are inputs typed + owner named + downstream consumer present? → produce control-bands record; otherwise → skip + escalate gap. Walk it before authoring so you don't ship an unowned drift policy.
