# AI Transcript to Traceable Requirement

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a traceable requirement record from a stakeholder-interview transcript: requirement statement, source quote, stakeholder owner, ambiguity flag, and link to the verbatim moment in the transcript.

**Ефективно для:** BAs running AI-assisted stakeholder interview capture; PMs converting verbatim into traceable backlog items; auditors checking requirement provenance.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "ai-transcript-to-traceable-requirement" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Stakeholder interview captured as transcript (recorded + transcribed).
- Requirements will be extracted and tracked downstream.
- Owner exists for requirement record after publication.
- Transcript permissions allow content extraction.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Interview not recorded; only memory notes — provenance impossible.
- Stakeholder is anonymous / un-attributable.
- Free brainstorm with no requirement intent.

## Prerequisites

| Interview transcript | text / JSON with timestamps | interview capture tool |
| Stakeholder roster | CSV | PM |
| Requirement template | Markdown / spec | BA |
| Owner for resulting record | handle / email | team roster |
| Ambiguity taxonomy | Markdown | BA lead |

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
