# AI Acceptance Criteria Hallucination Checklist

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a per-story checklist that vets AI-generated acceptance criteria for plausible-but-wrong shapes: invented happy paths, missing edge cases, fabricated metrics, contradictory constraints, before ACs enter sprint.

**Ефективно для:** BAs gating AI-generated acceptance criteria; QA leads catching AC hallucinations before sprint start; PMs reviewing AI-drafted stories.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "ai-ac-hallucination-checklist" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Acceptance criteria drafted by an LLM (or LLM-assisted).
- Story will enter a sprint backlog after this gate.
- Owner exists for the AC review.
- Story is for a software / agent feature, not pure research.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- ACs are fully human-authored — apply standard AC review.
- Story is a spike / research task with no production output.
- Single-story experiment with no downstream impact.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
