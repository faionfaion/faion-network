# Agent Eval Harness Bootstrap Recipe

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a CI-gated eval harness in one engineer-week: wires trajectory-eval-otel + llm-judge-rubric + record-replay + chaos-eval + behavioral-evals + llm-as-judge into a single runnable harness.

**One-paragraph:** Atomized methodologies exist (`trajectory-eval-otel`, `llm-judge-rubric-evidence-first`, `record-replay-debugging`, `chaos-eval-fault-injection`, `behavioral-evals-adversarial`, `llm-as-judge-harness`). Missing: the wiring playbook that turns those 6 into a working CI gate in one engineer-week. Right now P7 reinvents the integration for every agent.

**Ефективно для:** engineering teams shipping a new agent who need a working CI gate within one sprint; teams migrating ad-hoc eval scripts into a single harness; ML-platform builders standardising eval across multiple agents.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Team has an agent + ≥30 trajectory examples
- CI exists and can run a Python or TS harness in a job
- Owner exists for harness maintenance
- Budget allows one engineer-week of bootstrap effort

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Existing harness already passes the 6-capability test — extension, not bootstrap
- No trajectory data — collect first via observability
- n<3 instances — gut feel is faster

## Decision tree

The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` filters whether agent-eval-harness-bootstrap-recipe applies: root question — "Does the team have ≥30 trajectories AND a CI pipeline?". Branches lead to a specific core rule (e.g., `rule:r1`) when the methodology fits, or to a `skip:` conclusion when it does not.
