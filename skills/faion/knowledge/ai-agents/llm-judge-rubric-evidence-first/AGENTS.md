# Llm Judge Rubric Evidence First

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Builds an LLM-as-judge rubric (JSON output, evidence cited before scores, per-criterion, bias mitigations) and emits a judge-spec + sample rubric.

**One-paragraph:** Rating prompts ('rate 1-10') are noise. A real LLM judge demands a structured rubric, JSON output, evidence cited BEFORE the score, per-criterion scoring, and explicit bias mitigation (position, verbosity, self-preference, authority). This methodology converts an eval task profile into a deterministic judge-spec.

**Ефективно для:** solopreneur evaluating open-ended outputs (summaries, code reviews, agent transcripts) who refuses to ship hope.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Output is open-ended (summary, code review, plan, transcript).
- Exact-match / unit tests don't apply.
- ≥1 stronger judge model available than the system under test.
- Eval cost is bounded.
- Labeled examples exist OR can be co-authored with the judge.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Output is structured and exact-matchable.
- Judge model is weaker than SUT.
- Compliance forbids LLM-generated scores.
- Sample size <5 — write manual reviews.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Branches on criteria_count (1 → single-criterion focused; 2-5 → per-criterion structured; >5 → split into multiple judges), then on bias_targets (position → swap order; verbosity → length-penalty; self-preference → judge != SUT model). Each leaf cites a rule id in 01-core-rules.xml so the agent always cites which rule drove the choice — and can be replayed for audit.
