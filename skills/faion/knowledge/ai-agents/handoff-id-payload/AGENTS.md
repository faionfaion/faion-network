# Handoff Payload — ID + Minimal Metadata

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Constrains every multi-agent handoff to a typed `{task_id, target_agent, decision_metadata}` payload, with the receiving agent pulling state from a shared append-only store, preventing O(n²) context growth and enabling auditable replay.

**One-paragraph:** When agent A hands off to agent B in a multi-agent topology, the handoff payload is a structured `{task_id, target_agent, decision_metadata}` object — never the conversation history, never the raw input. Agent B reads task state from a shared store (file, queue, DB) keyed by `task_id`. The supervising router returns `SupervisorDecision` objects, not message threads. Each agent's context is sized to its job, not to the cumulative conversation.

**Ефективно для:** мульти-агентних мереж із спеціалізованими ролями (researcher → writer → editor; classifier → worker), де лінійний переказ всієї історії убиває контекст.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Multi-agent topology with role-specialised agents.
- Supervisor/worker pattern where the supervisor routes.
- Pipeline length is more than 2 hops or each step has a small relevant subset of cumulative state.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Single-agent loop — handoff is a no-op.
- Tightly-coupled co-reasoning where two agents must see each other's intermediate thoughts.
- Throwaway prototype where setting up a task store is more work than the agent.

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Shared store | File queue, Redis, DB, or object store with `get/append_event/set_status` ops | Infrastructure |
| Agent role registry | `target_agent` enum | Application config |
| Initial task seed | Inserted into the store before first handoff | Trigger source |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|---|---|
| `file-reference-passing` | Handoff payloads carry IDs, content lives in the store. |
| `idempotent-write-tools` | Append-only events make handoffs replayable. |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The root question is whether the work map is supervisor-routed, peer-to-peer collaborative, or hierarchical teams. Branches route to one of three topology shapes with the matching handoff and store conventions.
