# Agent Eval Cost Budget Policy

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a 3-cadence eval policy: nightly full suite, per-PR fast subset, weekly adversarial — with sampling rules and a judge-model fallback when budget breached.

**One-paragraph:** Evals can cost more than production traffic. Need a policy: nightly full / per-PR fast-subset / weekly adversarial; sampling rules; judge-model fallback when budget breached. No methodology today. This produces a versioned policy record + per-cadence schema + breach playbook.

**Ефективно для:** production agents with daily eval spend ≥$50; teams whose CI cost is dominated by evals; pre-GA agents that need both fast PR feedback and deep nightly coverage.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Eval cost is a measurable line item ≥$50/month
- ≥1 PR per day touches the agent
- Ground-truth set ≥30 examples exists
- Cost ceiling defined and visible

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Pre-MVP — manual eval is cheaper than authoring policy
- No CI pipeline yet — author CI first
- Single nightly cadence already works and costs <$10/day

## Decision tree

The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` filters whether agent-eval-cost-budget-policy applies: root question — "Is eval spend ≥$50/month AND ≥1 PR/day touches the agent?". Branches lead to a specific core rule (e.g., `rule:r1`) when the methodology fits, or to a `skip:` conclusion when it does not.
