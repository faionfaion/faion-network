# Idempotent Write Tools — Keys + Preview/Apply Pairs

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Requires every write tool to accept an agent-supplied idempotency_key and treat retries as no-op replays, and forces destructive or expensive operations into preview+apply pairs so the agent can show its work before the irreversible commit.

**One-paragraph:** Every tool that mutates state must accept an idempotency_key from the agent and be safe to re-run with the same key (returns the same result without duplicating the side effect). Destructive or expensive operations ship as `*_preview` + `*_apply` pairs, separating the agent's reasoning step from the irreversible commit step. Tools time out, networks flake, agent loops retry on transient errors — un-keyed writes silently double-charge, double-deploy, double-email.

**Ефективно для:** агентських інструментів з побічними ефектами — платежі, email, infra-зміни, видалення файлів, DB writes, external POSTs — будь-де, де "at-least-once" не = "exactly-once".

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Tool mutates external state: payments, emails, file deletes, infra, DB writes, external API POSTs.
- Tool side effect is destructive (delete) or expensive (deploy, charge) — split into preview+apply.
- Agent runs in a loop with automatic retry on tool errors.
- Tools exposed via MCP with at-least-once delivery.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Pure reads (`get_*`, `search_*`, `list_*`) — no side effect, no key needed.
- Append-only telemetry where duplicates are tolerable.
- Underlying API already idempotent by content hash (e.g. S3 PUT with same body).

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Key store | DB / Redis with TTL >=24h | Infrastructure |
| Tool registry | List of write tools needing keys | Engineering audit |
| Reviewer signoff (for preview/apply) | Human or guard-agent identity | Workflow design |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|---|---|
| `handoff-id-payload` | Idempotency keys flow with the task_id through the handoff store. |
| `gateway-fallback-chain` | Gateway retries must respect idempotency keys end-to-end. |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The root question is whether the tool mutates state. Branches then route to: no-key (pure read), key-required (write), or preview+apply pair (destructive/expensive). Each leaf maps to a rule.
