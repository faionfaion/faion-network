# Mcp Resource Vs Tool Vs Prompt

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Classifies every MCP capability as Tool/Resource/Prompt via the three-question test and emits a primitive-classification spec.

**One-paragraph:** The #1 MCP design bug is exposing a Resource as a Tool (LLM calls it unnecessarily and burns tokens) or a Tool as a Prompt (user can't side-effect properly). This methodology runs every capability through the three-question test (Does it side-effect? Is the user calling it directly? Does the model need to reason about its result?) and emits a classification table.

**Ефективно для:** solopreneur building an MCP server who wants the LLM to actually pick the right capability.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Building or refactoring an MCP server.
- Server exposes ≥1 capability that's currently a Tool (the default).
- Selection-accuracy or token cost matters.
- User-facing slash commands exist (or could).
- Read-only content (docs, configs) is part of the surface.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Server has exactly 1 obvious tool — no classification needed.
- Pure write surface — only Tools make sense.
- Pure data dump — only Resources.
- MCP server is throwaway scaffold.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Branches on side_effect (true → Tool), then on user_facing+!side_effect (true → Prompt; false → Resource). Each leaf cites a rule id in 01-core-rules.xml so the agent always cites which rule drove the choice — and can be replayed for audit.
