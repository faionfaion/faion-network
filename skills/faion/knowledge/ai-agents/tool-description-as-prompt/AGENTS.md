# Tool Description as Prompt

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Treat each tool description as a zero-shot teaching prompt with five named parts under 200 tokens, validated against a catalog-audit rubric.

**One-paragraph:** A tool definition becomes part of the system context every time the model decides whether to call a tool. Anthropic's engineering team reported state-of-the-art on SWE-bench achieved by rewriting descriptions, not changing the model. This methodology enforces a five-part structure (use-when, do-NOT-use-when, input contract, output contract, side effects), caps each description at 200 tokens, requires mutual anti-triggers between overlap pairs, mandates `MUTATING:` markers on destructive tools, and verifies the result with an audit-rubric schema that scores each tool 0-5 across the axes. Catalogs are re-evaluated quarterly; both tool-selection and argument-fill error rates are tracked as primary regression signals.

**Ефективно для:**

- MCP-агрегатори і tool-каталоги &gt; 10 інструментів — структуроване опис різко знижує mis-selection.
- Команди, в яких опис інструмента =  marketing-blurb або docstring — швидке покращення SWE-bench-style accuracy.
- Side-effect інструменти (DELETE, DROP, ROLLOUT) — MUTATING-prefix зупиняє accidental calls.
- Description-schema drift аудити — лінт-rule cross-check блокує phantom-arguments ще до production.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Catalog has ≥3 tools whose names share a verb-class (search/get/list etc.) or use cases overlap.
- The catalog is reachable by an agent loop (Claude, GPT, Llama agents — anything that picks tools by description).
- A 50-task eval set or trace store exists to measure pre/post selection-error rate.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Single-tool catalogs where there is no selection problem to begin with.
- One-off scripts where the agent calls a fixed sequence and tool-pick is hard-coded.
- Catalogs whose tools are auto-generated from OpenAPI specs and overwritten on every regen (apply at the spec layer instead).

| `score_catalog` | haiku | Five 0/1 checks against templates; deterministic. |
| `detect_overlap` | haiku | Lexical similarity + verb-class clustering. |

- [[terse-default-tool-output]] — description must declare summary/full mode and token bands.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree first asks for the tool's 5-axis audit score (5/5 = keep), then asks whether the tool mutates state (yes → `MUTATING:` rewrite), then whether any peer description has cosine &gt; 0.8 (yes → mutual-anti-trigger rewrite). Each leaf references a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`.
