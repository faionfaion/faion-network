# AI Feature Brief Extension Pack

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Adds the four AI-specific sections that classic PRDs miss — model choice, eval set, hallucination policy, cost guardrails — to a regular feature brief, producing an extended brief PMs and engineers can ship against.

**One-paragraph:** Classic PRDs assume deterministic software: features either work or don't. AI features add four axes a PRD must commit to before engineering starts — which model (and what happens when the provider deprecates it), which eval set gates promotion, what the hallucination policy is when the model is wrong (refuse / caveat / fall through to human), and what the cost guardrails are per request / per day / per outlier. This pack is a stack of four named sections that bolt onto any PRD template; output is one extended brief reviewed by product + engineering + finance.

**Ефективно для:** Команд, де PRD виглядає як для звичайної фічі, потім інженери два тижні шукають, що робити коли LLM «бреше»; pack дає чотири розділи, на які PM відповідає до старту — і інженери знають exact contract з першого дня.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- A classic PRD or feature brief already exists or is being drafted.
- The feature involves at least one LLM call user-facing.
- Product, engineering, and finance can review jointly within one sprint.
- The team agrees that AI features get scoped differently from deterministic features.
- A versioned PRD store (Notion, Confluence, repo) holds the artefact.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Feature uses no LLM (pure heuristics, classifier with known accuracy, deterministic logic).
- One-off experiment with no production exposure.
- Team has no governance burden (research lab, no users).
- PRD process is itself in flux — stabilise the base PRD format first.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Asks: (1) does a base PRD exist? (2) can all four sections (model / eval / policy / cost) be answered now? Leaves point to "publish", "collect missing inputs", or "escalate".
