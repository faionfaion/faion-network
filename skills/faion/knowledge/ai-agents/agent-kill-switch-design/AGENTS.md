# Agent Kill-Switch Design

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a runtime kill-switch spec for an agent: per-tenant + global + per-tool kill paths, latency budget <5s end-to-end, recovery / rollback path documented, both directions tested.

**One-paragraph:** How to design and test a runtime kill switch for an agent (per-tenant, global, per-tool). Required for production rollout but absent in most stacks. Output: kill-switch spec + test recipe (kill + recovery) + observability hooks + escalation runbook.

**Ефективно для:** agents exposed to non-internal users; agents with destructive tools (create / delete / pay); agents subject to safety review or regulatory scrutiny.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- You expose or operate the system to non-internal users (customers, paying or pilot)
- Failure of the safety control results in user-visible damage (cost, data, trust)
- Pre-prod verification of the control is feasible and budgeted
- Roll-forward and roll-back paths are both tested, not just documented

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Internal-only, dev-tier tools with no external blast radius
- Trivially reversible actions (DRAFT-only outputs, dry-run flags) where safety is implicit
- Cost of safety control > expected loss × probability over the next 90 days

## Decision tree

The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` filters whether agent-kill-switch-design applies: root question — "Is the agent exposed to non-internal users with non-trivial blast radius?". Branches lead to a specific core rule (e.g., `rule:r1`) when the methodology fits, or to a `skip:` conclusion when it does not.
