# LangChain Production Patterns

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Hardens a LangChain chain with fallbacks, retries, configurable fields, batch processing, and pinned deps; emits a hardening decision-record.

**One-paragraph:** A LangChain chain that boots in a notebook breaks in production from model outages, transient network errors, silent dep upgrades, and unbounded retries. This methodology turns a reliability profile (target uptime, latency budget, model providers available, dep policy) into a deterministic hardening plan: which `with_fallbacks` to wire, which retry strategy, which fields to expose for runtime config, and how to pin deps. Output is a JSON decision-record plus a chain-hardening patch.

**Ефективно для:** solopreneur shipping a paid LangChain agent who cannot get woken at 03:00 by a single provider outage.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Chain has paying or SLA-bound users (or imminently will).
- ≥2 LLM providers are available (or you can sign up for one).
- You control the chain wiring and can wrap nodes with `with_fallbacks` / `with_retry`.
- Deploys run from CI, not from a developer laptop.
- Failures cost money (downtime / refunded calls / refused work).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Prototype with ≤10 users; over-engineering kills velocity.
- Single-provider lock-in mandated by contract (cannot wire fallback).
- Chain is ad-hoc Jupyter analysis with no users.
- Latency budget is so tight (<200ms) that retries are useless — use a circuit breaker instead.

- [[langchain-observability]] — tracing is non-optional once you wire fallbacks.
- [[max-turns-circuit-breaker]] — retries × tools = turn explosion.
- [[langchain-workflows]] — when hardening becomes a graph, LangGraph wins.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Root question: provider count. ≥2 providers → wire `with_fallbacks`. Single → wire `with_retry` with exponential backoff. Then branches on uptime target (>99.5% → demand cross-region fallback + batched warm-pool) and on dep policy (locked → pin exact + hash; floating → at minimum upper-bound minor versions).
