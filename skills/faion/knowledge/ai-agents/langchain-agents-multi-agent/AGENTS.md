# LangChain Multi-Agent Systems

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Builds LangGraph multi-agent systems using one of three canonical patterns — supervisor routing, debate consensus, or hierarchical teams — with structured-output routing, hard round limits, and isolated unit tests per specialist.

**One-paragraph:** Multi-agent collaboration patterns and testing strategies using LangChain and LangGraph. Three patterns: Supervisor (one router → specialists), Debate (peer agents reach consensus via judge), Hierarchical (teams of teams under a coordinator). Use `with_structured_output(Route)` for routing, set a hard round limit on debates, compile each team subgraph independently. Unit-test specialists with mocked LLMs; integration-test the full graph with real calls.

**Ефективно для:** проєктів з ≥3 спеціалізованими ролями, де лінійний пайплайн неможливий, але мережа має бути auditable і testable.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Workflow has 3+ specialised agent roles.
- Routing decisions are domain-specific (different specialists for different inputs).
- Each specialist's logic is independently testable.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Linear workflow with no branching — use a single LangGraph workflow or LCEL chain.
- Agents need to share complex mutable state — race-condition risk.
- Latency critical — supervisor routing adds an LLM call per request.
- Team size small and no specialisation benefit.

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|---|---|
| `langchain-agents-architectures` | Each specialist uses one of the three single-agent architectures. |
| `handoff-id-payload` | Handoffs between specialists follow the typed payload contract. |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The root question is whether the work map suits routing (supervisor), consensus (debate), or nested teams (hierarchical).
