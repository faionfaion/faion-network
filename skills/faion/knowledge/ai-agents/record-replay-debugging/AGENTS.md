# Record-Replay Debugging

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a debugging spec wiring record-replay for agent runs: persist every LLM call + tool result; replay deterministically against a frozen recording.

**One-paragraph:** Agent failures are hard to reproduce: non-deterministic models + flaky tools + race conditions. Record-replay captures every LLM call + tool result + timestamp into a recording file; replay reads from the recording instead of hitting live services. Bug surfaces deterministically; fix lands in one iteration.

**Ефективно для:** team that can't reproduce a production agent failure; the only artefact is one user report and a stale trace.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Production agent failures are hard to reproduce.
- Multi-step agents with tool calls.
- Cost or risk prevents re-running against live services.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Single-call no-tool agents.
- Read-only agents.
- Prototype with no production failures.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Walks the drivers and picks a rule id per leaf. Each conclusion cites a rule in 01-core-rules.xml so the spec records the audit chain.
