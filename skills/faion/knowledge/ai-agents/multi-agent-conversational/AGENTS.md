# AutoGen-Style Conversational Multi-Agent Pattern

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Generates an AutoGen-style conversational multi-agent runner with capped sliding-window context, dual termination (phrase + max_turns), and per-turn budget audit.

**One-paragraph:** Two or more agents take sequential turns in a free-form conversation. Each agent receives a sliding window of recent turns (default last 3) plus the previous message, produces a reply, and the loop continues until a termination phrase appears or `max_turns` is reached. The pattern matches the AutoGen GroupChat / v0.4 event-driven core for tasks where the approach cannot be decomposed upfront — interactive debugging, negotiation, Socratic verification. This methodology ships a `ConversationalAgents` class with both guards wired and a per-turn token audit.

**Ефективно для:** інженера, який запускає інтерактивний дебаг / Socratic-перевірку — конверсація замість заздалегідь зафіксованого пайплайну.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Dynamic task where approach cannot be decomposed upfront (debugging, negotiation, Socratic).
- Adversarial verification — one agent proposes, another critiques, conversation converges.
- Open-ended exploration where the conversation path itself is the output.
- Agents need to negotiate a shared understanding before acting.
- A semantic termination signal can be defined (phrase, JSON flag, or output-shape check).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Task has a known sequential pipeline — use `sequential` or `hierarchical` instead.
- Production audit requires structured per-step decision logs — conversational turns are harder to parse.
- Latency budget tight — free-form runs always risk hitting `max_turns`.
- Agents need shared mutable state beyond message history — use `collaborative` workspace pattern.
- Two agents on identical model + identical system prompt — degenerates to monologue.

## Decision tree

The mandatory tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` decides whether conversational beats sequential/hierarchical: pick conversational when the path is unknowable upfront AND audit can tolerate prose turns. Otherwise pick sequential (known DAG) or hierarchical (manager + workers). Run it before scaffolding to avoid wrong-pattern cost.
