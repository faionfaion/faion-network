# Llamaindex Indexes Queries

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Picks the right LlamaIndex index type (Vector/Keyword/KnowledgeGraph/Tree/Summary) and query-engine shape and emits an indexing-spec.

**One-paragraph:** LlamaIndex ships five index types optimised for different query shapes. Picking VectorStoreIndex when the workload is multi-hop reasoning over a graph wastes time and tokens. This methodology converts a workload profile (query types, data shape, hop depth) into the right index + query_engine + response_synthesizer combo.

**Ефективно для:** solopreneur whose simple RAG plateaued and now needs to pick the right index shape for the workload.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Using LlamaIndex.
- Workload has multiple distinct query types or data shapes.
- Latency allows experimentation (you can A/B index types).
- Eval signal exists or can be built.
- Corpus shape known (graph-like, narrative, FAQ, summary-heavy).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Simple Q&A on prose — VectorStoreIndex is correct.
- Pure SQL workload — use [[llamaindex-sql-query]].
- Conversational follow-ups — use [[llamaindex-chat-engine]].
- No eval signal — measure before picking.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Branches on data_shape (graph → KnowledgeGraphIndex; tree-hierarchical → TreeIndex; flat-prose → VectorStoreIndex; FAQ-keyword → KeywordTableIndex), then on hop_depth (>1 → sub_question / multi_step query engine), then on response synthesizer. Each leaf cites a rule id in 01-core-rules.xml so the agent always cites which rule drove the choice — and can be replayed for audit.
