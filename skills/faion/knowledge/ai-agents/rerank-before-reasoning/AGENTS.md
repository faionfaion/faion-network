# Rerank Before Reasoning

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a RAG-stage spec inserting a cross-encoder reranker between retrieval and the reasoning model so top-k matches what the model needs, not what the embedder thought was close.

**One-paragraph:** Embedding-based retrieval returns top-k by cosine similarity, which doesn't match what the LLM needs to reason. A cross-encoder reranker reads (query, candidate) pairs and produces a relevance score; the LLM sees k_final relevant candidates instead of k_retrieved noisy ones. Saves context tokens and improves answer quality.

**Ефективно для:** RAG product whose top-1 hit is often related-but-wrong; the right doc sits at position 6.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- RAG pipeline retrieves top-k > 5 candidates.
- Top-1 cosine miss rate > 20%.
- Context budget tight; can't pass all k to LLM.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Embedding hits top-1 reliably.
- Latency-critical path (rerank adds 100-300ms).
- k_retrieved == 1.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Walks the drivers and picks a rule id per leaf. Each conclusion cites a rule in 01-core-rules.xml so the spec records the audit chain.
