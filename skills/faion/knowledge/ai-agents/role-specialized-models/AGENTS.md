# Role-Specialized Models

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a model-routing spec assigning each agent role (planner/coder/critic/summarizer) to the best-fit model rather than using one frontier model for everything.

**One-paragraph:** Using opus for every agent role is wasteful; using haiku for every role is reckless. Role-specialised routing maps each role to its best-fit model (planner=opus, coder=sonnet, summarizer=haiku, etc.) based on the role's competence floor and cost profile. This methodology emits a spec.

**Ефективно для:** team running multi-role agents whose monthly bill is dominated by opus calls on roles where sonnet would suffice.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Multi-role agent with >= 3 distinct roles.
- Cost optimization required.
- Quality benchmarks exist per role.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Single-role agent.
- Quality constraints make routing risky.
- All roles are top-tier (e.g., reasoning-heavy).

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Walks the drivers and picks a rule id per leaf. Each conclusion cites a rule in 01-core-rules.xml so the spec records the audit chain.
