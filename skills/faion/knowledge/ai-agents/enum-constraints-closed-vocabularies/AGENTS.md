# Enum Constraints for Closed Vocabularies

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Declares finite answer sets as Literal/enum so constrained decoders mask non-enum tokens to zero probability at sampling time, eliminating hallucinated labels and giving the highest accuracy-per-token ratio of any structured-output trick.

**One-paragraph:** Whenever the answer set is finite, declare it as a typed enum (`Literal[...]` in Pydantic, `enum` in JSON Schema) instead of a free-form string. Constrained decoders mask every non-enum token to probability zero, so a hallucinated label becomes mathematically impossible. The rule is a one-line schema change with the highest accuracy-per-token ratio of any structured-output trick — production classification tasks go from 80-95% raw to ~100% with `Literal[...]` plus strict mode.

**Ефективно для:** будь-яких полів класифікації з фіксованим набором значень: sentiment, severity, routing labels, статусні стани, мовні коди.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- A classification field has a finite, known set of valid values.
- The field maps to a downstream switch/case, DB enum column, or routing dispatch.
- Provider supports strict mode or a constrained decoder (OpenAI strict, Pydantic v2, Outlines, XGrammar, vLLM guided).
- Pipelines fail when an unknown label slips through.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Open vocabularies (free-text tags, novel entity types, user names) — enum would clip valid answers.
- Semi-open sets — use Literal + discriminated-union fallback instead.
- JSON-mode-only fallback paths on mini/nano models — enums are advisory there; pair with strict mode to enforce.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The root question is whether the value set is finite. The tree then routes finite-closed sets to `Literal[...]`, finite-mostly-closed sets to a discriminated union with a "novel" branch, and genuinely open sets to free-string. Each leaf maps to a rule in `01-core-rules.xml`.
