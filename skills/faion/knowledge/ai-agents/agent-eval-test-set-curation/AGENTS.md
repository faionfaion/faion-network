# Agent Eval Test-Set Curation

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a curated agent-eval golden set: trajectory cases + capability tags + provenance + version-control conventions — partitioned into fast-subset and full-suite buckets.

**One-paragraph:** RAG eval test-set methodologies exist but no agent-eval-specific guide covers trajectory cases, capability tags, and version control of the golden set. This produces a spec for sourcing, labelling, partitioning, and version-controlling the golden set; the harness consumes its output verbatim.

**Ефективно для:** first-time eval setup for a new agent; quarterly review of an existing golden set; replacing 'eyeballed 10 random examples' with a versioned set; turning real production failures into permanent regression cases.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Building an eval harness AND need ≥30 representative trajectories
- Production has ≥100 traces to sample from OR a domain expert can hand-author cases
- Tagging schema decided (capability, persona, difficulty)
- Version control system exists for the set

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- No traces and no domain expert — defer until either exists
- Tags would not affect any decision — premature taxonomy
- Existing test set already passes the 4 rules below

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Trace history OR domain expert | trace store OR person | observability OR SME |
| Capability taxonomy | list of tags | domain expert |
| Version-controlled location | git repo | team |

## Decision tree

The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` filters whether agent-eval-test-set-curation applies: root question — "Does the team have ≥30 trajectories OR can source them?". Branches lead to a specific core rule (e.g., `rule:r1`) when the methodology fits, or to a `skip:` conclusion when it does not.
