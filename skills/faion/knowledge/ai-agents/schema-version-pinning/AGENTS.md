# Schema Version Pinning

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a schema-evolution spec pinning JSON-schema versions per agent + migration policy + breaking-change protocol so deployed agents survive schema drift.

**One-paragraph:** Tool-use and structured-output schemas drift over time. Agents deployed against v1 schemas crash silently when v2 ships. This methodology emits a versioning spec: schemas carry semver, agents pin against minor versions, migration tools convert recorded calls forward.

**Ефективно для:** team whose deployed agents start emitting validation errors after a routine schema 'cleanup'.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Multiple agents share a tool-use schema.
- Schema changes more than once per quarter.
- Production deploys not redeployed in lockstep.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Single-tenant agent, schema co-deployed.
- Schema frozen indefinitely.
- Prototype with no production runs.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Walks the drivers and picks a rule id per leaf. Each conclusion cites a rule in 01-core-rules.xml so the spec records the audit chain.
