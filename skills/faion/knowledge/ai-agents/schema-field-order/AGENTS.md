# Schema Field Order

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a structured-output schema-ordering spec placing reasoning fields BEFORE final answer fields so the model thinks-then-answers within the JSON itself.

**One-paragraph:** When the LLM emits JSON with the final answer field first, it has to commit before reasoning. Reordering so reasoning/scratchpad/analysis fields come BEFORE the answer field forces the model to think first. Quality improves substantially without prompt changes.

**Ефективно для:** team using JSON-schema-constrained outputs whose answer quality plateaus despite better prompts.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Using JSON-schema-constrained outputs (OpenAI strict / Anthropic tool_use).
- Answer quality matters more than latency.
- Schema can be modified.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Free-form completions.
- Latency-critical (reasoning fields add tokens).
- Schema fixed by external contract.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Walks the drivers and picks a rule id per leaf. Each conclusion cites a rule in 01-core-rules.xml so the spec records the audit chain.
