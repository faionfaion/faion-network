# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Generates a working MCP server scaffold (stdio or Streamable HTTP) with discoverable tools, JSON Schema definitions, health probe, and Claude Code settings.json entry.

**One-paragraph:** Model Context Protocol is the open standard for exposing tools, resources, and prompts to LLM clients (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenAI Apps, etc.) without per-tool SDK coupling. This methodology produces a production-shaped MCP server in Python or TypeScript that ships a health/ping tool, declares every external tool with a flat JSON Schema, picks the right transport (stdio for local single-process, Streamable HTTP for remote multi-client), and emits a ready-to-paste client registration block. Versioning, error envelope, and OAuth Resource Server posture are baked into the output so the server is shippable, not a demo.

**Ефективно для:** інженера, який інтегрує внутрішні інструменти/дані в Claude Code чи інший MCP-клієнт — закриває петлю між API і агентом без custom SDK на кожен tool.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Need to expose tools, resources, or data to one or more MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenAI Apps) via a standardized protocol.
- Toolset is maintained separately from agent code — must version tools without redeploying every agent.
- At least one tool will be reused across ≥2 agents or projects.
- Target client supports MCP (verify the client's MCP spec version before scaffolding).
- A health/ping probe is acceptable as part of the tool surface (required for monitoring).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Sandboxed runtime with no IPC/network — MCP needs stdio pipe or HTTP socket.
- One-shot single-agent tool use — direct LangChain/LlamaIndex tool definition is cheaper.
- Binary streaming response (audio, video) — MCP returns text/JSON; binary requires base64 (heavy).
- Latency budget < 50 ms — stdio process spawn or HTTP round-trip is too costly.
- Requires bidirectional streaming inside a single tool call — MCP tool calls are request/response.

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Tool requirements | text or YAML list of `name + description + inputSchema + handler` | product / engineering brief |
| Target MCP client list | list (`claude-code`, `cursor`, `vscode-mcp`, `openai-apps`) | deployment plan |
| Auth posture | one of `none`, `bearer`, `oauth2.1` | security review |
| Transport choice | one of `stdio`, `streamable-http` | infrastructure plan |
| Tool execution code | Python or TypeScript handlers | existing internal services |

## Assumes Loaded

| Methodology | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| `geek/ai/ai-agents/schema-field-order` | Tool inputSchema field order steers the LLM through the tool call. |
| `geek/ai/ai-agents/schema-version-pinning` | Bake `schema_version` into every tool response payload for evolvable contracts. |
| `geek/ai/claude-code/skills/` (parent) | Where Claude Code reads `mcpServers` config; required to register the scaffolded server. |

## Task Routing

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Generate tool definitions from API spec | haiku | Mechanical mapping (API path → JSON Schema). |
| Author server scaffold + handlers | sonnet | Real code, error handling, transport plumbing — needs reliable code generation. |
| Review schemas for LLM discoverability | sonnet | Cross-checks description clarity, naming, schema flatness. |
| Design multi-server orchestration / OAuth posture | opus | Coordinates auth flow, namespacing, resource server registration. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/python-server-stdio.py` | Minimal Python MCP server (stdio) with health probe, one demo tool, registration JSON snippet. |
| `templates/python-server-streamable-http.py` | Streamable HTTP server scaffold with bearer auth and session-id management. |
| `templates/tool-schema.json` | Flat JSON Schema skeleton for one tool — descriptions, required fields, examples. |
| `templates/_smoke-test.py` | Runs the server in a subprocess, calls `list_tools` and `call_tool`, asserts shape. |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-model-context-protocol.py` | Validates a server manifest (or live server via mcp-inspector handshake) against the output contract — tool name uniqueness, schema flatness, health probe presence, auth on remote. | Pre-merge of any MCP server PR; CI gate. |

## Decision tree

The mandatory tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` decides transport: if the server runs co-located with the client and only ever serves one process, stdio is the right call (lowest latency, no auth needed). If ≥2 clients, remote location, or org-wide reuse — Streamable HTTP with OAuth Resource Server posture. If the brief asks for sub-50 ms latency, no shared tools, or binary streaming inside a call — skip MCP and use a direct SDK tool. Run it the moment a tool-exposure question lands, before any code is written.
