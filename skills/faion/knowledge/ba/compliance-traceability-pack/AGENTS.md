# Compliance Traceability Pack

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a compliance traceability pack for a regulated BA engagement (KYC / FHIR / GDPR / SOC2): requirement-to-regulation map, evidence inventory, control owner table, audit-ready exports.

**Ефективно для:** BAs on FinTech / HealthTech / GovTech engagements; compliance officers auditing requirements coverage; PMs gating release on regulatory traceability.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "compliance-traceability-pack" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Engagement touches a named regulation (KYC / FHIR / GDPR / SOC2 / EU AI Act).
- Requirements exist or are being authored.
- Owner exists for the pack.
- Audit deadline exists or is foreseeable.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Engagement is fully unregulated.
- Compliance handled by a separate team with their own artefact (link out).
- Pilot / spike with no production launch.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
