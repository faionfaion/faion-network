# Agile BA Frameworks Mapping

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Map BA competencies onto Scrum ceremonies + SAFe levels (Team / Program / Solution / Portfolio) — produces a `spec` of which BA activity fires when.

**One-paragraph:** Map BA competencies onto Scrum ceremonies + SAFe levels (Team / Program / Solution / Portfolio) — produces a `spec` of which BA activity fires when. Captured as a versioned artefact downstream agents and reviewers consume without re-deriving rationale. Mechanism: typed input → bounded transformation → contract-checked output.

**Ефективно для:**

- Onboarding BA до Scrum / SAFe org.
- Audit BA-activity coverage across ceremonies.
- Multi-team coordination — який BA fires when.
- Performance-review framework для BA contributions.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Org runs Scrum or SAFe (Team/Program/Solution/Portfolio).
- ≥1 BA active across teams.
- Cadence is consistent (sprint length, PI length).
- Activity inventory can be enumerated.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Non-agile delivery model (waterfall, ad-hoc).
- Solo BA scope (no cross-team mapping needed).
- Pre-agile transition discovery; use change-management instead.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Recent task context (30 days) | Markdown / tracker | BA |
| Write access to artefact store | repo / wiki | engagement manager |
| Named downstream owner | stakeholder list | BA |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/agile-ba-frameworks.json` | Skeleton artefact with required fields |
| `templates/_smoke-test.json` | Minimum viable filled artefact |
| `templates/sprint-ba-activities.md.j2` | Per-sprint BA activity checklist — refinement, planning, in-sprint, review and retrospective duties. |
| `templates/sprint-ba-activities.md` | Per-sprint BA activity checklist — refinement, planning, in-sprint, review and retrospective duties. Generated from `templates/sprint-ba-activities.md.j2` by `tpl-jinja --migrate`; do not hand-edit. |

Files the packer does not ship standalone have their bodies inlined under `## Template Contents` at the end of this file - read them there, do not fetch the path.

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-agile-ba-frameworks.py` | Validate artefact against output-contract | After subagent returns; pre-commit |
