# Acceptance Criteria

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces stable, testable acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then or rule-based) with cross-reference IDs (AC-FEATURE-NN) tying spec, test-plan, and CI report.

**One-paragraph:** Produces stable, testable acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then or rule-based) with cross-reference IDs (AC-FEATURE-NN) tying spec, test-plan, and CI report. This methodology codifies the rules, output contract, antipatterns, and decision tree so the artefact is reproducible across teams and audits.

**Ефективно для:**

- SDD spec.md authoring перед coding subagent'ом — AC треба stable + testable.
- Freeform user story → testable criteria translation.
- Regression scenarios from bug reports — definition-of-done gate перед merge.
- Story-slicing signal: AC count > 7 — час ділити.
- Gherkin → Cucumber/Behave/Playwright wiring, де BA review і CI ділять один артефакт.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Authoring AC for SDD spec.md files before a coding subagent picks up the task.
- Translating a freeform user story or stakeholder note into testable criteria.
- Generating regression scenarios from a bug report so the fix has a definition-of-done gate before merge.
- Splitting an oversized story: when AC count exceeds 7 per story, that is the slicing signal.
- Wiring AC to executable specs (Gherkin to Cucumber / Behave / Playwright) so BA review and CI share one artefact.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Pure spike / research tasks where the outcome is a learning, not a behaviour.
- Throwaway prototypes or demos with a lifespan under one sprint.
- UX-only changes where verification is subjective (visual polish, brand tone).
- Operational runbook changes (server tweaks, cron edits) — use smoke checks instead.
- Negotiation-heavy external contracts where AC ossify before scope is stable.

Files the packer does not ship standalone have their bodies inlined under `## Template Contents` at the end of this file - read them there, do not fetch the path.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input fields, scores, thresholds) to a concrete action, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which variant of the methodology to apply.

## Template Contents

Bodies of the templates above that the packer does not ship as standalone files, inlined here so they are deliverable.

### `templates/ac-coverage.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# AC coverage: ratio of stories with AC linked.
set -euo pipefail
[ -f "${1:-}" ] || { echo 'usage: ac-coverage.sh <stories.json>'; exit 2; }
jq '{total: (.stories | length), with_ac: ([.stories[] | select(.acs | length > 0)] | length)}' "$1"
```
