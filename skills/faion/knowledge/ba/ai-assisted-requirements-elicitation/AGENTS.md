# AI-Assisted Requirements Elicitation

## Summary

**One-sentence:** BABOK-grounded methodology for BAs to draft user stories + AC from elicitation artifacts via LLM with hallucination guards (compliance-domain rules, evidence per claim).

**One-paragraph:** BABOK-grounded methodology for BAs to draft user stories + AC from elicitation artifacts via LLM with hallucination guards (compliance-domain rules, evidence per claim). Captured as a versioned artefact downstream agents and reviewers consume without re-deriving rationale. Mechanism: typed input → bounded transformation → contract-checked output.

**Ефективно для:**

- Bulk drafting stories + AC з interview transcripts.
- Compliance domains (banking, healthcare, legal) — hallucination guards critical.
- Multi-source synthesis (interviews + docs + tickets).
- Acceleration BA коли team scaled до agents+humans.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Elicitation artifacts exist (transcripts, docs, interview notes).
- Output reviewed by named BA before merge.
- Compliance-domain hallucination guards required.
- Output schema (stories + AC) known.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- No elicitation artifacts collected yet — interview first.
- Single-conversation greenfield discovery — human-led is faster.
- Domain agents are not trusted for the regulatory class (defer to human-only).
