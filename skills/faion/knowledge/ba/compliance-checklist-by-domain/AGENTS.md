# Compliance Checklist by Domain

## Summary

**One-sentence:** A domain-indexed compliance checklist BAs apply during requirements validation to surface missing non-functional and regulatory items before sign-off.

**One-paragraph:** Requirements sign-off without a compliance checklist routinely misses non-functional items (data residency, retention, audit logging, accessibility). This methodology indexes checklists by compliance domain (GDPR / HIPAA / PSD2 / SOC2 / WCAG) so a BA can pick the relevant domain(s) and walk the checklist. Each item carries: rationale, evidence-required, owner, source-clause. Output: a checked checklist + gap list feeding the requirements backlog.

**Ефективно для:**

- Pre-sign-off requirements validation on regulated builds.
- Domain-onboarding BAs new to GDPR / HIPAA / PSD2.
- Pre-audit gap-finding (4–8 weeks before audit).
- Vendor RFP-response compliance section.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- the engagement touches at least one regulatory domain (GDPR / HIPAA / PSD2 / SOC2 / WCAG)
- named owner accepts the checked checklist
- a draft requirements set exists to validate against
- compliance scope is bounded (not 'all of EU')

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- no regulatory domain applies — skip the checklist entirely
- the engagement is purely internal with no PII / payments
- compliance team owns this artefact already — defer

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| draft requirements set | MD / wiki / ALM | BA |
| regulatory scope statement | MD | compliance / legal |
| named owner | org chart | BA / compliance |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input completeness, ownership clarity, regulatory context, scope size) to a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about whether to run, skip, or split this methodology.
