# Benefit Sustainment Checklist

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Post-launch 90-day checklist verifying realized benefits match projected business case (metric, target, measured-value, variance, named owner).

**One-paragraph:** Post-launch 90-day checklist verifying realized benefits match projected business case (metric, target, measured-value, variance, named owner). The artefact is captured as a versioned record (JSON or Markdown) downstream agents and reviewers consume without re-deriving rationale. Mechanism: typed input → bounded transformation → contract-checked output.

**Ефективно для:**

- Post-launch 30/60/90 day benefits review.
- Process-improvement initiative ROI tracking.
- Compliance audit показуючи realized vs projected outcomes.
- Continuous-improvement loop coли наступний investment thresholded на попередньому result.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Feature/process change shipped with documented business-case targets.
- Measurement infrastructure can capture the target metric.
- Named owner accountable for sustainment.
- Review cadence fits within 30/60/90 day frame.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Spike / prototype with no business-case targets.
- Already-sunset initiative.
- Measurement infrastructure missing and unreachable.
