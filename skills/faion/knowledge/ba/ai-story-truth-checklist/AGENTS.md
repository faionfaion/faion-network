# AI Story Truth Checklist

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a per-story checklist that vets AI-generated user stories for plausible-but-wrong shapes: invented personas, conflated jobs, fabricated metrics, missing edge cases — before they enter the backlog.

**Ефективно для:** BAs running AI-assisted story drafting; PMs gating LLM-drafted backlog entries; QA leads detecting story-level hallucinations early.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "ai-story-truth-checklist" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- User stories drafted by an LLM (or LLM-assisted).
- Stories will enter a sprint backlog after this gate.
- Owner exists for the story review.
- Persona / job catalogue exists OR can be supplied.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Stories are fully human-authored — apply standard story review.
- Spike / research story with no production output.
- Single-story experiment with no downstream impact.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Template Contents

Bodies of the templates above that the packer does not ship as standalone files, inlined here so they are deliverable.
