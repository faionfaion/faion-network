# BA Governance

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Establishes decision rights (RACI), change-control workflow, and stakeholder communication plan for a requirements stream before requirements work starts.

**One-paragraph:** Establishes decision rights (RACI), change-control workflow, and stakeholder communication plan for a requirements stream before requirements work starts. The methodology pins the artefact shape, ties every conclusion to a rule, and routes the operator via a decision tree that always terminates either on an applicable rule or on `skip-this-methodology`. Apply when preconditions hold; skip via the tree otherwise.

**Ефективно для:**

- New product / squad — governance set-up before requirements work begins.
- Cross-stakeholder project (sponsor + dev + ops + legal) — communication plan mandatory.
- Existing process audit: rework, scope drift, sign-off ambiguity observed.
- Regulated build (SOX / HIPAA / GDPR) — decision audit trail required.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Setting up decision rights, change-control, and approval workflow before requirements work starts.
- Project crosses three or more stakeholder groups (sponsor, dev, ops, legal).
- Elicitation logistics and technique selection prepared before interviews / workshops.
- Regulated build (SOX / HIPAA / GDPR) requiring a decision audit trail.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Solo founder / single-team early MVP — formal governance burns time.
- Pure engineering refactor with no external stakeholders — PR review suffices.
- Research spike / discovery sprint where goal is learning, not committing scope.
- Crisis incident — use incident command, not governance workflow.

## Task Routing

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `decide-skip-vs-apply` | sonnet | Decision-tree application requires judgement. |
| `draft-ba-governance` | sonnet | Output drafting needs structure + light judgement. |
| `validate-output` | haiku | Schema validation is mechanical. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/decision-record.md` | Markdown decision record — context + options + decision + owner + last_reviewed |
| `templates/decision-instance.json` | JSON instance of a filled decision record |
| `templates/governance.md` | Full governance skeleton — decision-authority + change-control + comms-plan + owners |
| `templates/scaffold-governance.sh` | Bash scaffold that writes `governance.md` into `.aidocs/in-progress/<project>/` |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-ba-governance.py` | Validate produced artefact against the schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml` | CI on each artefact change; pre-commit; `--self-test` in unit run |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree starts from a concrete observable signal and routes each branch to a `<conclusion ref="rule-id">` resolved against `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it whenever you are unsure whether this methodology applies — the tree always terminates either on an applicable rule or on `skip-this-methodology`.
