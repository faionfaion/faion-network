# Ambiguity and Contradiction Detector

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Scans a requirements doc against a closed checklist (vague quantifiers / undefined terms / contradictory ACs / missing edge-cases / unowned decisions) and emits a per-finding report with severity, evidence quote, and remediation owner.

**One-paragraph:** Scans a requirements doc against a closed checklist (vague quantifiers / undefined terms / contradictory ACs / missing edge-cases / unowned decisions) and emits a per-finding report with severity, evidence quote, and remediation owner. The methodology pins the artefact shape, ties every conclusion to a rule, and routes the operator via a decision tree that always terminates either on an applicable rule or on `skip-this-methodology`. Apply when preconditions hold; skip via the tree otherwise.

**Ефективно для:**

- Pre-handoff review: BA → eng — ambiguous requirements cause rework loops.
- Multi-stakeholder requirements (sponsor + ops + legal + eng) — contradictions inevitable.
- Regulated build: contradiction in requirements blocks audit signoff.
- Re-validation: 90-day old doc — ambiguity drift since approval.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Requirements doc length ≥2 pages.
- Doc enters handoff (BA → eng / BA → audit) or re-validation window.
- Doc owner is reachable and accountable for remediation.
- Closed-checklist categories cover the doc's content shape.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Doc length ≤1 page — overhead exceeds value.
- Doc passed prior detector run within last 7 days.
- Research spike with no handoff intent.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Requirements doc | Markdown / Confluence / Word | BA owner |
| Closed-checklist categories | YAML | BA core team |
| Owner roster for remediation | Markdown / org chart | BA lead |

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `decide-skip-vs-apply` | sonnet | Decision-tree application requires judgement. |
| `draft-ambiguity-contradiction-detector` | sonnet | Output drafting needs structure + light judgement. |
| `validate-output` | haiku | Schema validation is mechanical. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/report.md.j2` | Markdown report skeleton — finding rows with severity + evidence + owner |
| `templates/report.md` | Markdown report skeleton — finding rows with severity + evidence + owner Generated from `templates/report.md.j2` by `tpl-jinja --migrate`; do not hand-edit. |
| `templates/report-instance.json` | JSON instance of a filled report (machine-readable mirror) |

Files the packer does not ship standalone have their bodies inlined under `## Template Contents` at the end of this file - read them there, do not fetch the path.

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-ambiguity-contradiction-detector.py` | Validate produced artefact against the schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml` | CI on each artefact change; pre-commit; `--self-test` in unit run |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree starts from a concrete observable signal and routes each branch to a `<conclusion ref="rule-id">` resolved against `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it whenever you are unsure whether this methodology applies — the tree always terminates either on an applicable rule or on `skip-this-methodology`.

## Template Contents

Bodies of the templates above that the packer does not ship as standalone files, inlined here so they are deliverable.
