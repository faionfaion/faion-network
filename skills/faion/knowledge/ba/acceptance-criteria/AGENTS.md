# Acceptance Criteria

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Explicit, testable Given-When-Then or rule-based criteria per user story with mapping to ≥1 test case and explicit edge / negative / non-functional coverage.

**One-paragraph:** Explicit, testable Given-When-Then or rule-based criteria per user story with mapping to ≥1 test case and explicit edge / negative / non-functional coverage. Captured as a versioned artefact downstream agents and reviewers consume without re-deriving rationale. Mechanism: typed input → bounded transformation → contract-checked output.

**Ефективно для:**

- Pre-sprint AC writing для кожної user story.
- Bug fixes: expected vs actual behavior documentation.
- Technical story success measurable (latency, throughput).
- Integration з BDD tooling (Cucumber, SpecFlow).

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- User story enters sprint without AC.
- Output is consumed by QA + dev (test design + acceptance).
- Story is appropriately sized (≤8-10 AC per story).
- Domain context is reachable for clarification.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Spike / research stories — output contract is the right artifact.
- System-level NFRs (SLOs, capacity) — belong in ADR / SLA.
- Pure infra / ops tasks with no user-visible behavior.
- Story with 30+ scenarios — split first.
