# CR Impact Memo Template

## Summary

**One-sentence:** A standardised CR impact memo with scope / cost / schedule / risk deltas and a recommendation, produced by BA and signed by the approver from change-request-impact-rubric.

**One-paragraph:** CRs without an impact memo land in the steering committee as raw debate. Memos surface scope / cost / schedule / risk deltas with evidence per delta, plus a recommendation. Output: a structured Markdown memo attached to the CR record. Reads in <5 minutes; reviewed by the approver chosen by `change-request-impact-rubric`.

**Ефективно для:**

- Engagements with formal change-control gates.
- Regulated programs where memo trail is audit evidence.
- Steering-committee submissions needing concise framing.
- Recurrent-CR programs where memo template reduces drafting time.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- a CR record exists with the affected IDs
- impact rubric has bin and approver assigned
- named author accepts memo ownership
- approver named

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- no CR record — fix that first
- impact rubric not run — run it first
- CR is trivial (bin S) and can be approved inline

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input completeness, ownership clarity, regulatory context, scope size) to a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about whether to run, skip, or split this methodology.
