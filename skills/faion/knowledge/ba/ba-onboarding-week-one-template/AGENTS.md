# BA Week-One Onboarding Template

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Five-day, artefact-driven onboarding plan that gets a BA from "first commit" to "ready to write requirements" — day-level outputs committed to a week-one-pack/ folder.

**One-paragraph:** P4 outsource BAs rotate across projects; cost of starting blank is paid every time. This methodology fixes the sequence — Day 1 artefact pull, Day 2 stakeholder map + interview script, Day 3 glossary intake, Day 4 process baseline, Day 5 risk register + gap memo — and pins each step to a committed output. Output is a `checklist` artefact (`week-one-pack/` validator status) the BA can hand to a PM or successor without verbal context.

**Ефективно для:**

- P4 outsource BA rotation across projects every few weeks.
- New-project handoff від PM до BA з SOW + accessible workspace.
- Audit-ready discovery trail (compliance, retention).
- Mid-engagement successor handover where artefact pack still valid.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- BA joins project they have not worked on (or returned after >60 days).
- Project has a paying client and an existing scope document (SOW, brief).
- BA has ≥20% capacity for first 5 working days.
- ≥1 product/business owner reachable within first 3 days.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Project lifetime <2 weeks.
- BA replacing an in-flight BA mid-sprint — use hand-off checklist instead.
- Pre-sales / estimation engagement — use ops-pre-sales-discovery.
- Internal product where BA is also founder — discovery informal already.
