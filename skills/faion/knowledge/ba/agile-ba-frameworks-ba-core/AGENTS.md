# Agile BA Frameworks

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Picks the right Agile-BA framework (Scrum-BA, SAFe-BA, Disciplined Agile, Dual-Track) for a given team shape + cadence + regulatory bar, with named per-sprint BA activities and IIBA Agile-Extension 7-principle fit-report.

**One-paragraph:** Picks the right Agile-BA framework (Scrum-BA, SAFe-BA, Disciplined Agile, Dual-Track) for a given team shape + cadence + regulatory bar, with named per-sprint BA activities and IIBA Agile-Extension 7-principle fit-report. The methodology pins the artefact shape, ties every conclusion to a rule, and routes the operator via a decision tree that always terminates either on an applicable rule or on `skip-this-methodology`. Apply when preconditions hold; skip via the tree otherwise.

**Ефективно для:**

- New squad — BA framework selection перед sprint-1.
- Existing team retro: BA activities либо missing либо overloaded.
- Scaling shift: single team → SAFe RTE — BA role змінюється.
- Discovery-delivery friction: discovery PB drifts faster than delivery PB.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- New initiative entering agile delivery OR major team / scope change in flight.
- BA function exists in the org (or being established).
- Constitution / playbook captures the framework decision.
- IIBA Agile Extension + at least one scaling reference (SAFe / DA / LeSS) on the table.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Single-team Scrum with no scaling concern and no regulatory bar.
- Greenfield product discovery — use continuous-discovery / user-story-mapping.
- Non-software domain (marketing ops, HR change) — vocabulary misapplies.
- Pure tooling questions (Jira API, Linear webhooks) — frameworks are vendor-neutral.

## Prerequisites

| Artefact | Format | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|

## Task Routing

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `decide-skip-vs-apply` | sonnet | Decision-tree application requires judgement. |
| `draft-agile-ba-frameworks` | sonnet | Output drafting needs structure + light judgement. |
| `validate-output` | haiku | Schema validation is mechanical. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/decision-record.md` | Markdown decision record — context + options + decision + owner + last_reviewed |
| `templates/decision-instance.json` | JSON instance of a filled decision record |
| `templates/framework-fit.md` | Framework-fit report — IIBA AE / DA / SAFe comparison + recommendation + 7-principle gap table |
| `templates/sprint-ba-activities.md` | Per-sprint BA activities checklist (refinement → planning → during → review → retro) |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-agile-ba-frameworks.py` | Validate produced artefact against the schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml` | CI on each artefact change; pre-commit; `--self-test` in unit run |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree starts from a concrete observable signal and routes each branch to a `<conclusion ref="rule-id">` resolved against `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it whenever you are unsure whether this methodology applies — the tree always terminates either on an applicable rule or on `skip-this-methodology`.
