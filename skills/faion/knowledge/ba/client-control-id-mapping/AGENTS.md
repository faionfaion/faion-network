# Client Control ID Mapping

## Summary

**One-sentence:** A bi-directional map between client-supplied compliance control IDs and internal requirements + tests, queryable by auditor in < 5 minutes.

**One-paragraph:** Auditors arrive with a control list and demand 'show me evidence for control X-12'. Hand-maintained spreadsheets rot; engineers refactor tests and break the link silently. This methodology installs a versioned mapping with: (a) source-of-truth client control list, (b) internal requirement / test IDs per control, (c) evidence URL per pairing, (d) named owner per control, (e) broken-link detector. Output: a YAML/JSON mapping + auditor query CLI.

**Ефективно для:**

- Regulated builds (HIPAA, PCI, SOX, ISO 27001, SOC 2).
- Pre-audit hardening (4–8 weeks before audit).
- Vendor onboarding where the buyer dictates control IDs.
- Multi-tenant SaaS with per-tenant compliance overlay.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- client provides a discrete control list (IDs not free-form text)
- internal requirements + tests are ID-addressable
- named owner accepts maintenance of the mapping
- evidence is queryable (logs / CI / dashboards)

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- no client control list — request one first
- internal IDs are not stable across releases — fix the ID system first
- no auditor will ever query this — premature compliance

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input completeness, ownership clarity, regulatory context, scope size) to a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about whether to run, skip, or split this methodology.
