# AI-Enabled Business Analysis (Business Analyst)

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a methodology spec for the business-analyst role on AI-assisted workflows: governance, agentic-system specs, AI TRiSM compliance, and the BA-specific checklists feeding requirements / AC / story workflows.

**Ефективно для:** business analysts integrating LLMs into the BA role; BA leads governing AI use across the function; compliance reviewers gating AI-BA outputs under AI TRiSM.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "ai-enabled-business-analysis" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- BA function applies LLM assistance on ≥1 workflow.
- Source corpora include documents or transcripts.
- Compliance regime applies.
- Owner exists for the BA methodology.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- BA team has no LLM access and no plan to add one.
- Domain is too specialised — model hallucinates on terms.
- Stakeholder dynamics make AI analysis of communications ethically inappropriate.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Template Contents

Bodies of the templates above that the packer does not ship as standalone files, inlined here so they are deliverable.
