# UI Library Advanced Patterns

## Summary

**One-sentence:** UI library advanced patterns spec: compound components, accessible modal portals, CSF 3 stories with interaction tests, and slot-based composition.

**One-paragraph:** UI library advanced patterns spec: compound components, accessible modal portals, CSF 3 stories with interaction tests, and slot-based composition. Decision tree in `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes the caller to apply-or-skip based on observable signals; the validator script `scripts/validate-ui-lib-patterns.py` enforces the output contract before the orchestrator accepts the artefact.

**Ефективно для:**

- UI Library Advanced Patterns — fits when the triggering activity recurs and the artefact needs to be auditable.
- Solo operator who wants a fixed template instead of improvising under pressure.
- Downstream consumer (human reviewer or agent) who must sign off without re-deriving the reasoning.
- Recurring cycle (sprint, weekly, per-incident) rather than a one-off task.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- The triggering activity for `ui-lib-patterns` appears in the operator's workload at least once per cycle.
- The operator has authority to act on the artefact this methodology produces (write access, sign-off rights).
- A named consumer exists for the output — either a human reviewer or a downstream agent.
- An auditable source-of-truth is available for the inputs this methodology requires.
- Library has shipped basic primitives and now needs richer composition (compound APIs).
- Modal/dialog/popover surface must work with focus-trap + portal + scroll-lock.
- Interaction tests (Storybook play functions) are needed to lock keyboard semantics.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- One-off, never-to-repeat work — methodology overhead does not pay back.
- No named consumer for the artefact — output will be orphaned regardless of quality.
- Inputs are not available from a citable source-of-truth (paraphrased substitutes are worse than skipping).
- Library still missing basic primitives — apply ui-lib-basics first.
- No interactive surfaces beyond static cards/buttons — advanced patterns unjustified.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Routes (composition shape, interaction surface, test depth) to compound-only / compound+slots / leave-flat. Every leaf cites a rule from `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it before drafting the artefact: it decides apply-vs-skip, picks any variant, and ties the chosen leaf to the rule the orchestrator must enforce.
