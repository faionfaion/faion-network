# Vendor Eval Pilot Template

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Vendor-evaluation pilot template: scoped 2-4 week pilot with measurable acceptance criteria, named owner, costed exit plan if pilot fails.

**One-paragraph:** Vendor-evaluation pilot template: scoped 2-4 week pilot with measurable acceptance criteria, named owner, costed exit plan if pilot fails. The methodology pins the artefact shape via a JSON Schema (see `content/02-output-contract.xml`), ties every conclusion in the decision tree to a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`, and gates output via `scripts/validate-vendor-eval-pilot-template.py` (stdlib-only, `--self-test` available). Apply when preconditions in Applies-If hold; route to `skip-this-methodology` otherwise. The output artefact is versioned (semver), owner-signed (named human, never 'team' / 'we'), and consumable by a downstream agent or human reviewer without re-deriving the rationale.

**Ефективно для:**

- Architect runs technology-selection cycle із ≥2 vendor candidates.
- Pilot budget existing (2-4 week eng-time + vendor's free / trial tier).
- Acceptance criteria visible (perf SLI, integration depth, ops runbook coverage).
- Procurement gate потребує artefact'd pilot result для go/no-go.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Vendor selection cycle in motion with ≥2 candidates
- 2-4 week pilot budget available
- Acceptance criteria pre-defined (not invented during pilot)
- Costed exit plan possible if pilot fails (sunk-cost limit known)

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Only one candidate — pilot is just an integration; skip template
- <1 week budget — pilot too small to produce signal
- No acceptance criteria — pilot becomes a tour of features
- Sunk-cost commitment regardless of result — pilot is theatre

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree starts from a concrete observable signal and routes each branch to a `<conclusion ref="rule-id">` resolved against `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it whenever you are unsure whether this methodology applies — the tree always terminates either on an applicable rule or on `skip-this-methodology`.
