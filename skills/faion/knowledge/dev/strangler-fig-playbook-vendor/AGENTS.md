# Strangler-Fig Migration Playbook (Vendor Delivery)

## Summary

**One-sentence:** End-to-end strangler-fig migration playbook framed for vendor delivery — slice picking, traffic shifting, fallback semantics, exit criteria.

**One-paragraph:** End-to-end strangler-fig migration playbook framed for vendor delivery — slice picking, traffic shifting, fallback semantics, exit criteria. This methodology pins the testable rules, output contract, and procedure that turn the abstract pattern into a reviewable artefact. Apply when the preconditions hold; otherwise the decision tree routes to `skip-this-methodology`. Output is the artefact described in `content/02-output-contract.xml`, validated by the bundled script.

**Ефективно для:**

- Team that needs a reusable, reviewable take on strangler-fig migration playbook (vendor delivery) for production code or operations.
- Cross-team alignment on the contract this methodology produces (no hand-rolled variants).
- Onboarding new contributors to the software-architect domain via a worked example + decision tree.
- Audit: traceable rule IDs in every conclusion of the decision tree.
- Pre-flight check before scoping a larger initiative that depends on this pattern.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Task signal matches the scope of this methodology (see decision tree).
- The produced artefact has a named downstream consumer who will review it.
- Required inputs (data, repo state, infra access) are reachable when the work starts.
- The team can absorb the procedure without violating the failure-mode detectors.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Task is clearly outside this methodology's scope — see `06-decision-tree.xml` for the skip branch.
- A more specific methodology already covers the exact use case better.
- The required preconditions for the failure-mode repairs cannot be met.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree starts from a concrete observable signal and routes each branch to a `<conclusion ref="rule-id">` resolved against `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it whenever you are unsure whether this methodology applies — the tree always terminates either on an applicable rule or on `skip-this-methodology`.
