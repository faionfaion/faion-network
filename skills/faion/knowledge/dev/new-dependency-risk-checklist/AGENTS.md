# New Dependency Risk Checklist

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a new-dependency risk record — licence, maintainer count, last release, CVE history, alternative-considered, owner — so adding a transitive dependency stops being a one-click decision.

**One-paragraph:** Produces a new-dependency risk record — licence, maintainer count, last release, CVE history, alternative-considered, owner — so adding a transitive dependency stops being a one-click decision. The methodology pins shape + owner + evidence + outcome review so the artefact becomes a reviewable operating tool rather than folklore. Inputs are validated against a JSON schema; outputs are gated by the `## Decision tree` so the agent skips the methodology when preconditions don't hold.

**Ефективно для:** tech leads and security reviewers approving net-new npm/pypi/cargo dependencies who need a written risk record before a 'tiny utility' becomes a CVE / licence / supply-chain liability.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- A named trigger has fired (release, incident, schedule, scope change) that warrants producing the artefact.
- The owner is a named person (role:handle), not a team alias or channel.
- The required input artefacts in `## Prerequisites` are available and machine-readable.
- The downstream consumer for the produced artefact is known (review board, CI gate, customer, regulator).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Trigger is vague ("when needed", "soon"); rewrite the trigger first.
- No named owner — refuse to produce; assign first.
- Inputs are missing or non-deterministic; fix the upstream observability before applying.
- A different, already-pinned methodology handles this exact decision (avoid duplicate artefacts).

## Prerequisites

| Input artifact | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger record | text / ticket link | upstream alerting / planning queue |
| Owner identity | `role:handle` string | RACI / org directory |
| Input artefacts | as listed in `02-output-contract.xml` `required` | upstream methodology output |
| Prior artefact (if exists) | JSON matching the output contract | repo `.product/new-dependency-risk-checklist/` |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/skeleton.md` | Markdown skeleton of the artefact with all required sections. |
| `templates/header.yaml` | Frontmatter schema (owner, version, last_reviewed, trigger_url). |
| `templates/_smoke-test.json` | Minimum-viable filled JSON instance, parseable by the validator. |

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-new-dependency-risk-checklist.py` | Validate an artefact JSON against the output-contract schema + cross-field rules. | Pre-merge of the artefact PR + weekly staleness scan. |

- [[code-review]] — gates the artefact before merge.
- [[incident-decision-template]] — sibling 2-minute decision record.
- [[regression-test-first-bugfix-workflow]] — sibling workflow that pins red-test-first discipline.

## Decision tree

The mandatory tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` first checks whether preconditions hold (named trigger + named owner + typed inputs). If yes, it routes between the full artefact form and a minimal-record fallback when the trigger is below the materiality threshold. If preconditions don't hold, the conclusion is to skip this methodology and route the work upstream.
