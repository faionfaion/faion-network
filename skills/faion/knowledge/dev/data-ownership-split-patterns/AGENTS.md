# Data Ownership Split Patterns

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Ownership split pattern selection for entity per service

**One-paragraph:** Data Ownership Split Patterns codifies a recurring "monolith-to-services migration architecture" decision into a decision record artefact with a typed input contract, a JSON-schema-checked output, and a decision tree that routes between the operational variants. It exists because adjacent methodologies cover the surrounding topic without pinning the precise output shape this task produces. The artefact carries owner, version, last-reviewed date, and citations to every input used, so downstream agents and human reviewers can consume it without re-deriving the rationale.

**Ефективно для:**

- A team that already runs the parent activity but has no canonical decision record shape.
- Multi-agent workflows that need a contract-checked artefact instead of free-form prose.
- Pre-merge / pre-release gates where a missing field must block the pipeline.
- Audit scenarios — every decision must trace to a named input + a named owner.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Task is an instance of "monolith-to-services migration architecture" or a closely-adjacent variant.
- All Prerequisites artefacts exist or can be produced before the run starts.
- Output will be consumed by a downstream agent or human reviewer (not discarded).
- Tier `pro` or higher is unlocked for the operator (gating enforced by tier-manifest).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- A working team-owned artefact already covers this gap — replace, do not duplicate.
- The decision being made is a greenfield prototype with no production users.
- Regulatory or legal context overrides any in-methodology guidance — defer to counsel.
- Single-use throwaway task — overhead of the contract is not justified.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (preconditions satisfied, stake level, downstream-consumer presence, regime overlay) to a concrete rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about whether to run this methodology, defer to a peer, or skip outright.
