# Vector DB Tuning Runbook

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a tuning runbook for a vector store: HNSW / IVF parameters, ef_search vs recall, shard sizing, refresh cadence, with rollback steps and recall-vs-latency targets.

**Ефективно для:** RAG engineers tuning a production vector store on latency / recall regression; SREs running capacity reviews on pgvector / Qdrant / Weaviate / Milvus; ML-ops setting refresh cadence after a re-embed.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "vector-db-tuning-runbook" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Vector store backs a production RAG surface with traffic.
- Recall and latency targets exist for the surface.
- Recent regression observed OR upcoming load change.
- Owner exists for the index after tuning.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Index has <100k vectors — brute-force is fine, tuning overhead unjustified.
- Vendor manages tuning end-to-end (managed serverless RAG).
- Surface is experimental with no traffic.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Template Contents

Bodies of the templates above that the packer does not ship as standalone files, inlined here so they are deliverable.
