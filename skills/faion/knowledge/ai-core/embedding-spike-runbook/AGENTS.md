# Embedding Spike Runbook

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a triage runbook for embedding-cost / embedding-latency spikes: detection signals, suspected causes (model swap, index rebuild, batch retry), containment, postmortem.

**Ефективно для:** RAG-using teams where embedding cost spiked 5x overnight or vector store latency exploded and on-call has no runbook to triage from.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "embedding spike runbook" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a single accountable owner is named; the decision tree routes preconditions to a run/skip outcome. Source material grounded in: Galileo embedding security / common embedding-cost spike root causes.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Task is an instance of the recurring "embedding spike runbook" decision OR a closely-adjacent variant.
- Operator has the artefacts named in Prerequisites available before starting.
- Output will be consumed by a downstream agent, gate, or named human reviewer.
- A single accountable owner can be named.
- Tier == geek or higher.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Team already maintains a working artefact for this gap — replace, do not duplicate.
- Single-use throwaway task — overhead of the contract is not justified.
- Regulatory regime mandates a vendor governance platform — defer to vendor flow.
- Greenfield prototype with no production users yet.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question tree: (1) preconditions present? - no = skip; yes (2) variant detected per topic-specific signal? - routes to the appropriate produced variant. Terminal branches reference rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
