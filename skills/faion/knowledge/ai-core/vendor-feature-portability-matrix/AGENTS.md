# Vendor Feature Portability Matrix

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a portability matrix comparing LLM-vendor feature parity (tool use, JSON mode, streaming, vision, batch, caching) with a migration delta + risk per feature for moving from lock-in to a multi-vendor gateway.

**Ефективно для:** platform leads planning a multi-model gateway migration; finance / procurement on vendor concentration risk; PMs scoping a 2-month migration sprint.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "vendor-feature-portability-matrix" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Team currently single-vendor with material spend (≥$5k/month) on LLM.
- ≥2 candidate vendors exist with overlapping capability.
- A migration timeline (≤6 months) is on the table.
- Owner exists for the matrix after publication.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Single-vendor lock-in is contractually required (e.g., regulated long-term agreement).
- Team budget too small to justify the audit overhead (<$500/mo).
- Roadmap requires a vendor-specific feature with no parity (e.g., specific tool integration).

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Template Contents

Bodies of the templates above that the packer does not ship as standalone files, inlined here so they are deliverable.
