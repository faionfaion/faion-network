# Tool-Call Schema Design Checklist

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a single design-this-tool-correctly checklist that bundles verb-object naming, description-as-prompt, bundle-vs-split, idempotent-write, structured-errors, enum-constraints, terse-default-output into one pass over a new tool-call schema.

**Ефективно для:** LLM-agent developers drafting a new tool schema before shipping; reviewers gating tool PRs; platform owners standardising tool-card shape across teams.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "tool-call-schema-design-checklist" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- A new tool-call schema is being authored or reviewed.
- Tool will be exposed to an LLM agent (not internal-only API).
- Owner exists for the resulting tool card.
- Schema target is JSON Schema / OpenAPI / Anthropic tool spec.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Tool is internal-only with no LLM caller — REST-design rules apply, not this checklist.
- Single-throwaway tool used for one experiment.
- Wrapper around an existing tool with identical schema — re-use original card.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
