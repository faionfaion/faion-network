# Agent Observability Stack Blueprint

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a deployable observability spec wiring OTel + LLM-judge + cost ledger + trajectory storage + drift dashboard into one stack, with a vendor decision tree across LangSmith / Langfuse / Helic...

**One-paragraph:** faion has reference catalogues (llm-observability-stack-2026, llm-observability) but no buildable blueprint. Engineers can't evaluate options without reading 5 docs. This produces a deployable stack diagram + opinionated vendor pick per use case + minimum data model. Output: stack-decision artefact + integration plan + week-1 eval-loop wiring.

**Ефективно для:** teams shipping an LLM agent to production with paying users; engineering leads choosing between LangSmith / Langfuse / Helicone / Phoenix; SREs adding OTel traces to an agent pipeline; PMs requesting a drift dashboard.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Team shipping an LLM agent to production OR pre-prod with paying users
- Eval scores or cost are not currently visible per request
- ≥2 LLM providers OR ≥2 prompt variants are in play
- Owner exists for the dashboard once shipped

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Pre-PMF prototype with <100 requests/day — manual logs are cheaper
- Compliance requires fully self-hosted with no external SaaS option
- Team already on a working stack (LangSmith etc.) and just needs prompt-eng

## Decision tree

The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` filters whether agent-observability-stack-blueprint applies: root question — "Is the agent in production OR pre-prod with paying users?". Branches lead to a specific core rule (e.g., `rule:r1`) when the methodology fits, or to a `skip:` conclusion when it does not.
