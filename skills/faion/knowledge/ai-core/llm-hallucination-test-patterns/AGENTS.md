# LLM Hallucination Test Patterns

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Catalogs 6 hallucination test patterns (fact_probes / grounding_required / refusal_correctness / citation_verification / contradiction_tests / off_topic_rejection) and packages each as a CI-gated test class with anchored gold labels.

**One-paragraph:** Catalogs 6 hallucination test patterns (fact_probes / grounding_required / refusal_correctness / citation_verification / contradiction_tests / off_topic_rejection) and packages each as a CI-gated test class with anchored gold labels. The methodology pins the artefact shape, ties every conclusion to a rule, and routes the operator via a decision tree that always terminates either on an applicable rule or on `skip-this-methodology`. Apply when preconditions hold; skip via the tree otherwise.

**Ефективно для:**

- RAG / agent / extraction feature shipping до production.
- Hallucination — top-3 failure mode на customer-visible AI flows.
- Test-pattern reuse: 6 universal patterns → applicable до 80% AI features.
- CI gate: hallucination-rate >X% blocks merge.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- AI feature ships LLM output to end users (RAG / agent / extraction / summary).
- Hallucination is in top-3 known failure modes for the feature.
- Human SMEs available to author gold labels.
- CI can run the test suite on PR.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Non-LLM features (deterministic NLP, search ranking with no generation).
- Creative-content output without consensus correctness.
- Existing eval framework already enforces hallucination coverage.

## Task Routing

| Sub-task | Model | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `decide-skip-vs-apply` | sonnet | Decision-tree application requires judgement. |
| `draft-llm-hallucination-test-patterns` | sonnet | Output drafting needs structure + light judgement. |
| `validate-output` | haiku | Schema validation is mechanical. |

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/test-case.py` | Python test-case scaffold (pytest-style) wired to the output contract |
| `templates/suite-config.yaml` | Suite-level config: per-attack-class or per-pattern coverage thresholds |

Files the packer does not ship standalone have their bodies inlined under `## Template Contents` at the end of this file - read them there, do not fetch the path.

## Scripts

| File | Purpose | When to call |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `scripts/validate-llm-hallucination-test-patterns.py` | Validate produced artefact against the schema in `content/02-output-contract.xml` | CI on each artefact change; pre-commit; `--self-test` in unit run |

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree starts from a concrete observable signal and routes each branch to a `<conclusion ref="rule-id">` resolved against `content/01-core-rules.xml`. Use it whenever you are unsure whether this methodology applies — the tree always terminates either on an applicable rule or on `skip-this-methodology`.

## Template Contents

Bodies of the templates above that the packer does not ship as standalone files, inlined here so they are deliverable.

### `templates/test-case.py`

```python
"""Test-case scaffold for LLM Hallucination Test Patterns.

Wire each case to the schema in content/02-output-contract.xml.
Run with pytest. Add ≥10 cases per attack-class / pattern.
"""
from __future__ import annotations


CASES = [
    # (case_id, attack_class_or_pattern, input_text, expected_behavior)
    ("case-001", "<class>", "<input>", "<expected: refusal | grounded | etc>"),

def evaluate(model_response: str, expected: str) -> bool:
    # Concrete evaluator per pattern; see content/01-core-rules.xml
    # for per-pattern pass/fail criteria.
    raise NotImplementedError("wire to your eval pipeline")
