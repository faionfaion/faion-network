# Champion Challenger Pattern for RAG

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Spec for keeping last week's winner running as champion while next week's challenger benches in shadow traffic — without leaking user traffic across arms.

**One-paragraph:** RAG benches happen weekly: chunking, embeddings, reranker, prompt — every component has variants. Without a champion-challenger pattern, teams either deploy untested winners (regression risk) or run parallel UI experiments (slow + user-confusion). This methodology codifies a 7-day cycle: current champion serves 100% of user traffic; challenger reads the same queries in shadow mode (no user-visible answer) and produces parallel responses; an LLM-as-judge or eval rubric compares them; the winner becomes next week's champion. Config artefact specifies arms + traffic allocation + judge + promotion criteria + cleanup cadence; validator enforces no traffic leakage.

**Ефективно для:**

- RAG команди, які weekly bench chunking / embeddings / reranker і хочуть data-driven rollout.
- Системи з high cost-of-error (legal/medical RAG) — shadow eval перед user-facing deploy.
- Multi-component pipelines (retrieval → rerank → generate) — кожен компонент має champion-challenger арм.
- Compliance/audit: tracked promotion history = full decision trail.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- RAG system in production with ≥ 1000 queries/day (statistical power).
- Traffic mirror / shadow-mode capability (challenger can read traffic without writing to user).
- Eval rubric or LLM-as-judge exists to score the comparison.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Single-component pipeline (one prompt only) — A/B is cheaper than champion-challenger.
- Volume &lt; 1K queries/day — sample size too small for weekly promotion.
- Greenfield RAG with no champion yet — bootstrap with a static baseline first.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, eval scores, stakes, noise ratio, etc.) to a concrete action, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which variant of the methodology to apply.
