# Team AI Usage Policy

## Summary

**One-sentence:** 1-page team-facing policy spec: always-OK list, never-OK list, ask-first list, incident-response path. Owner + quarterly review locked in.

**One-paragraph:** Every product team needs a team-facing AI usage policy; 99% don't have one. Existing AI-governance work targets ML-engineers (wrong audience). This methodology produces a 1-page policy artefact with three explicit lists (always-OK, never-OK, ask-first) + a 4-step incident-response runbook + a named owner + quarterly review cadence. Output is a versioned Markdown spec validated by CI on every team change.

**Ефективно для:**

- Команди 3-50 розробників, які копіпастять у Cursor/Copilot/Claude без правил.
- Компанії, що handlуть customer data, source code, sales/legal docs, PII — швидкий policy за день.
- Post-incident: hot-fix policy перед audit, з incident-response runbook'ом.
- Quarterly AI-governance review: версіонована policy = audit trail.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Team has 3-50 developers using AI tools (Cursor / Copilot / Claude / ChatGPT / CLI agents).
- Company handles ANY of: customer data, source code, sales/legal docs, PII, regulated data.
- No existing AI usage policy OR existing policy is &gt; 6 months old.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Team uses zero AI tooling.
- Company-wide AI policy already exists and is &lt; 6 months old; refresh that document instead.
- Solo founder with no team yet.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals (input shape, eval scores, stakes, noise ratio, etc.) to a concrete action, each leaf referencing a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`. Use it when in doubt about which variant of the methodology to apply.
