# Agent Context Engineering Corpus Standard

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Spec for the canonical corpus an agent assembles per task — sources, chunking, ranking, citation, freshness — so two agents on the same task produce comparable contexts.

**One-paragraph:** Spec for the canonical corpus an agent assembles per task — sources, chunking, ranking, citation, freshness — so two agents on the same task produce comparable contexts. This methodology codifies the rules, output contract, failure modes, and decision tree needed for a spec produced by an agent applying agent context engineering corpus standard. The deliverable is validated against an explicit JSON Schema and routed through a decision tree that maps observable signals to rule ids in `01-core-rules.xml`.

**Ефективно для:**

- Building a reproducible spec for agent context engineering corpus standard across teams.
- Reviewing AI-or-human work against an explicit contract instead of vibes.
- Wiring the output into downstream automation (CI gates, observability, post-mortems).
- Avoiding the failure modes listed in `03-failure-modes.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- the agent assembles a per-task corpus from multiple sources (docs, code, chats, tickets)
- two agents on the same task must produce comparable corpora (reproducibility matters)
- the corpus feeds an LLM call whose output downstream consumers depend on

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- agent uses a single source verbatim (no chunking, no ranking) — corpus standard is overkill
- agent is a one-shot prototype with no second consumer — wait until reproducibility matters
- the corpus is itself the deliverable to a human reviewer — use research-synthesis methodology

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree maps observable signals from inputs and intermediate artefacts to a rule from `01-core-rules.xml`, telling the agent which variant of the methodology to apply or when to stop. Walk it on every fresh invocation; do not memo-ise outcomes across distinct engagements.
