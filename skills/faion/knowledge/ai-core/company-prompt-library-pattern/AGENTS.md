# Company Prompt Library Pattern

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a versioned spec describing a company's checked-in `prompts/` library — namespace map (per-role / per-task), the override layer between faion defaults and company patterns, the eval gate, and the named owner.

**Ефективно для:** Engineering organisations adopting an LLM agent (Faion / Claude Code / Cursor) where every dev currently copy-pastes prompts from chat UIs, prompts are not versioned, and there is no canonical company tone / context / coding-convention layer.

**One-paragraph:** Pins the recurring "adopt agent org-wide and override with company patterns" decision into one auditable spec. The spec names a single accountable owner, a layered namespace (faion defaults → role-pack → company override → repo override), an eval gate that blocks prompt PRs without a rubric pass, and a regression-detection plan. Designed for teams that have already passed the "should we use an LLM" gate and now need the prompt artefacts to be first-class citizens in the software lifecycle — tested, governed, and deployed with the same rigour as code.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Team has ≥3 developers all interacting with an LLM coding agent independently.
- No checked-in `prompts/` directory exists, OR existing one has no owner / no eval gate.
- A single accountable owner can be named (no "team" / "we").
- Output will be consumed by a downstream PR template + CI eval job (not a one-off doc).
- Tier == geek or higher (gating enforced by tier-manifest).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- The team already runs a working prompt library with evals and an owner — improve, do not rewrite.
- The org has < 3 LLM-using devs — overhead is not justified.
- Regulatory regime mandates a vendor governance platform — defer to vendor's authoring flow.
- Single-use throwaway tool — versioned library is overkill.

| Existing role definitions (PM / dev / QA / SRE) | text / wiki | team roster |
| Company tone-of-voice doc, if any | md | brand / comms repo |
| Repo's CONVENTIONS.md / AGENTS.md | md | code repo root |

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question tree: (1) preconditions present? (inventory + owner + ≥3 devs) → no = skip; yes (2) library size < 20 prompts? → emit single-file library spec; ≥20 → emit per-role-pack namespace spec. Both terminal branches reference rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
