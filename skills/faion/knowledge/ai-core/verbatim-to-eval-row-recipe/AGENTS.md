# Verbatim To Eval Row Recipe

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a recipe for converting a customer-zero feedback verbatim (chat message, support ticket, voice transcript) into a deduplicated, labelled eval row that lands in the regression set within one day.

**Ефективно для:** RAG / agent owners closing the customer-zero feedback loop fast; QA leads building a regression set from real failures; PMs measuring eval-row growth as a velocity metric.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "verbatim-to-eval-row-recipe" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Team runs an LLM-agent surface with live users.
- User feedback exists in a structured channel (Intercom / Zendesk / Slack-bot).
- Regression eval-set exists OR can be created.
- Owner exists for the eval-set.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- No customer feedback channel — bootstrap that first.
- Eval set is fully synthetic and frozen by design (e.g., regulator-supplied).
- Team is pre-PMF with <20 active users.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
