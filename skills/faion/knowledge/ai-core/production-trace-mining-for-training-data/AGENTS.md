# Production Trace Mining for Training Data

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Pinned method to mine PII-scrubbed production traces into a fine-tune candidate dataset — labels inferred, capability stratified, owner and review cadence locked in.

**One-paragraph:** Production traffic is the richest source of training data for any deployed LLM-agent, but most teams either ignore it (and stay stuck on prompt engineering) or dump it raw into a fine-tune (and leak PII, overfit on noise). This methodology turns the recurring "fine-tune vs prompt-engineer" decision into a reviewable spec: which traces qualify, how labels are inferred, how capabilities are stratified, who owns the dataset, when it expires. Output is a `trace-mining-spec.json` artefact downstream fine-tune jobs consume without re-deriving rationale.

**Ефективно для:**

- "Fine-tune vs prompt-engineer" decision (4-week worst-case cadence).
- Перетворити stale prompt-eng practice на data-driven cycle.
- PII-scrub + label inference + capability strat в одному spec'у.
- Versioned dataset з owner + retention + outcome review.
- Команда вже має eval harness, але fine-tune ще ні.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Recurring "fine-tune vs prompt-engineer" decision on the operating cadence.
- Production traces are PII-scrubbed (see `pii-scrubbing-recipe-for-eval-sets`).
- Named accountable owner exists.
- Repository / wiki space hosts the versioned spec.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Greenfield prototype без production users.
- Fewer than 3 instances per year — review cadence costs more than it returns.
- Regulator mandates a different template — defer to legal.
- No PII-scrub recipe locked — block on `pii-scrubbing-recipe-for-eval-sets` first.

## Decision tree

See `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. The tree decides between high-volume heuristic labeling and low-volume LLM-judge labeling, and routes out if PII-scrub is not yet locked. Walk it before drafting the spec; mining without a scrub recipe leaks PII into the training set.
