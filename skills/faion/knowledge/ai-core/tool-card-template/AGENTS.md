# Tool Card Template

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a one-page tool card combining name, description-as-prompt, schema, error codes, eval rows, and owners — the artefact other tool-design methodologies feed into.

**Ефективно для:** LLM-agent developers shipping a new tool to a paying agent surface; platform owners standardising tool-card shape across teams; PMs requesting a single ground-truth tool spec.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "tool-card-template" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- A new tool is being added to an LLM agent surface.
- Tool will be invoked by an autonomous or supervised agent.
- Owner exists for the tool card after publication.
- Eval rows can be supplied (≥3 representative call examples).

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Tool is internal-only with no LLM caller.
- Tool is a thin wrapper around an existing tool with identical card — link the original.
- Throwaway tool for a single experiment with no ongoing maintenance.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
