# Weekly RAG Spotcheck Protocol

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a weekly checklist + report for RAG retrieval quality: 20-row sample, judge-score deltas, top regressions, action items routed to indexer / embedder / prompt owners.

**Ефективно для:** RAG owners running a weekly retrieval-quality cadence; PMs tracking recall regression as a leading indicator of churn; SREs gating index refresh on stable retrieval health.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "weekly-rag-spotcheck-protocol" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a named accountable owner signs every record. The decision tree at `content/06-decision-tree.xml` routes preconditions and variant signals to a run / skip / variant outcome, with every conclusion referencing a rule id in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- RAG surface in production with ≥1k retrievals per week.
- Eval / judge harness exists OR can be set up.
- Owner exists for retrieval quality.
- Cadence is weekly or being introduced.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- RAG traffic <100 retrievals/week — sample size is unreliable.
- Surface has no eval / judge harness AND no plan to add one.
- Static FAQ surface with no embedding drift.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question gate: (1) preconditions present? (2) variant detected per the methodology-specific signal? Routes to run / skip / variant. Every conclusion references a rule id from `content/01-core-rules.xml`.

## Template Contents

Bodies of the templates above that the packer does not ship as standalone files, inlined here so they are deliverable.
