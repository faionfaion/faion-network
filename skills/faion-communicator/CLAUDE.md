2. Ask about past specifics, not future hypotheticals
3. Talk less, listen more

**Thomas-Kilmann:** Competing | Collaborating | Compromising | Avoiding | Accommodating

**Radical Candor:** Care Personally + Challenge Directly

**SPIN:** Situation → Problem → Implication → Need-Payoff

**Pyramid Principle:** Lead with answer → Support with arguments → Base with evidence
