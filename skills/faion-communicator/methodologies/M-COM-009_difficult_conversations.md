## The Problem

Avoiding difficult conversations creates:
- Festering resentment
- Repeated problems
- Damaged trust
- Passive-aggressive behavior
- Eventual explosion

---

## Crucial Conversations Framework

A conversation is "crucial" when:
- Stakes are high
- Opinions differ
- Emotions run strong

### Seven Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 1. Start with Heart | Know what you really want |
| 2. Learn to Look | Notice when safety is at risk |
| 3. Make it Safe | Restore safety when needed |
| 4. Master My Stories | Separate fact from interpretation |
| 5. STATE My Path | Share your view respectfully |
| 6. Explore Others' Paths | Understand their perspective |
| 7. Move to Action | Agree on clear next steps |

---

## 1. Start with Heart

Before the conversation, ask yourself:

```
What do I really want?
- For me?
- For them?
- For the relationship?
- For the organization?

How would I behave if I really wanted this?
```

### Avoid the "Fool's Choice"

False dilemma: "Either I speak up and damage the relationship, OR I stay silent and the problem continues."

Reality: You can be both honest AND respectful.

---

## 2. Learn to Look

Watch for signs that safety is at risk:

### Silence (Withdrawing)

| Sign | Example |
|------|---------|
| Masking | Sarcasm, sugarcoating |
| Avoiding | Changing subject |
| Withdrawing | Shutting down |

### Violence (Attacking)

| Sign | Example |
|------|---------|
| Controlling | Cutting off, overstating |
| Labeling | "You're being defensive" |
| Attacking | Personal criticism |

### Physical Signs
- Arms crossed
- Looking away
- Raised voice
- Tears
- Flushed face

---

## 3. Make It Safe

When you see silence or violence, pause content and restore safety:

### Mutual Purpose
Show you care about their goals:
"I want to find a solution that works for both of us."

### Mutual Respect
Show you value them:
"I respect your expertise and want to understand your perspective."

### Contrasting
Clarify what you don't mean:
"I'm not saying you're incompetent. I am saying this specific approach has issues."

### Apologize (When Appropriate)
"I'm sorry I didn't bring this up sooner. That wasn't fair to you."

---

## 4. Master My Stories

Separate observation from interpretation:

```
FACT: "You submitted the report on Thursday"
STORY: "You don't care about deadlines"
FEELING: "I'm frustrated"
```

### Path to Action

```
See/Hear → Tell a Story → Feel → Act
```

To change the outcome, change the story:

| Victim Story | Ownership Story |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "They don't respect me" | "I haven't clearly communicated my needs" |
| "They're incompetent" | "They might have constraints I don't know" |
| "They don't care" | "They might prioritize differently" |

---

## 5. STATE My Path

Share your view using this sequence:

| Letter | Action | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **S**hare facts | Start with observations | "The report was due Tuesday, arrived Thursday" |
| **T**ell your story | Your interpretation | "I'm concerned about reliability" |
| **A**sk for their path | Invite their view | "What happened from your perspective?" |
| **T**alk tentatively | Avoid absolutes | "I might be missing something..." |
| **E**ncourage testing | Welcome pushback | "Do you see it differently?" |

### Example Script

```
"I'd like to talk about the project timeline. (Purpose)

The last three milestones were delivered 2-3 days late. (Facts)

I'm starting to worry about whether we'll hit the launch date. (Story)

But I might be missing context. (Tentative)

Can you help me understand what's happening? (Ask)

I'm open to hearing I'm wrong about this. (Encourage)"
```

---

## 6. Explore Others' Paths

Use AMPP to understand their perspective:

| Letter | Action | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **A**sk | Open questions | "What's your view?" |
| **M**irror | Reflect emotions | "You seem frustrated" |
| **P**araphrase | Restate content | "So you're saying..." |
| **P**rime | Guess if stuck | "Are you worried about X?" |

### Don't

- Interrupt
- Dismiss their feelings
- Prepare your rebuttal while they talk
- Say "but" immediately

---

## 7. Move to Action

End with clear commitments:

```
WHO does WHAT by WHEN?
How will we follow up?
```

### WWWF Template

| Element | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **W**ho | Who is responsible? |
| **W**hat | Specifically what action? |
| **W**hen | By what date/time? |
| **F**ollow-up | How will we check progress? |

---

## DESC Script

For assertive confrontation:

```
D - Describe: "When [specific behavior]..."
E - Express: "I feel [emotion]..."
S - Specify: "I would like [specific change]..."
C - Consequences: "If this changes, [positive]. If not, [negative]."
```

### Example

```
D: "When I receive Slack messages at 10pm expecting immediate response..."
E: "I feel stressed and unable to disconnect from work..."
S: "I would like us to agree that non-urgent messages can wait until morning..."
C: "This would help me be more focused during work hours.
    If it continues, I'll need to turn off notifications entirely."
```

## Common Difficult Conversations

### Performance Issue

```
"I want to discuss your work on [PROJECT].
Specifically, [FACT 1] and [FACT 2].
This impacts [CONSEQUENCE].
I value your contributions and want you to succeed.
Help me understand what's going on.
What support do you need?"
```

### Saying No to Boss

```
"I want to help with [REQUEST].
Currently I'm committed to [EXISTING WORK].
If I take this on, [IMPACT ON OTHER WORK].
Could we discuss priorities?
Which should I deprioritize to make room?"
```

### Peer Conflict

```
"I'd like to clear the air about [SITUATION].
From my perspective, [YOUR VIEW].
I recognize you might see it differently.
I value our working relationship.
Can we find a way forward that works for both of us?"
```

---

## Preparation Checklist

```
Before the conversation:
□ What do I really want? (for me, them, relationship)
□ What are the facts (not stories)?
□ What's my contribution to the problem?
□ What might they be thinking/feeling?
□ What safety issues might arise?
□ What's my opening line?
□ What's the best outcome?
□ What's the worst outcome?
□ What's my fallback if it goes poorly?
```
