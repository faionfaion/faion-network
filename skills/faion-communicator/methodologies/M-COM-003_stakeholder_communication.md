## The Problem

Different stakeholders have different communication needs. Using the wrong approach leads to misunderstandings, resistance, and missed requirements.

---

## Five Dialogue Modes

| Mode | When | Technique |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Interview** | Gathering requirements | Open questions, probing |
| **Brainstorm** | Generating options | Diverge → Cluster → Converge |
| **Clarification** | Resolving ambiguity | Paraphrase, boundary questions |
| **Validation** | Confirming understanding | Summarize, seek confirmation |
| **Socratic** | Deep exploration | Question assumptions |

---

## Mode 1: Interview

### Interview Protocol

```
1. Context: "What's the current situation?"
2. Problem: "What problem are you facing?"
3. Impact: "How does this affect you/business?"
4. Goal: "What would success look like?"
5. Constraints: "Any limitations I should know?"
6. Priority: "What's most important?"
```

### Question Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Open | Explore | "Tell me about your workflow" |
| Probing | Dig deeper | "Why is that important?" |
| Clarifying | Understand | "What do you mean by X?" |
| Hypothetical | Envision | "What if you could...?" |
| Summary | Confirm | "So you're saying...?" |

---

## Mode 2: Brainstorm

### Process

```
1. DIVERGE (10-15 min)
   - Generate as many ideas as possible
   - No judgment, wild ideas welcome
   ↓
2. CLUSTER (5 min)
   - Group similar ideas
   - Name the clusters
   ↓
3. CONVERGE (10 min)
   - Vote on priorities
   - Select top ideas for action
```

### Facilitator Prompts
- "What else could we try?"
- "Let's build on that idea..."
- "What's the opposite approach?"
- "What would [competitor/expert] do?"

---

## Mode 3: Clarification

### When to Clarify
- Vague terms: "fast", "easy", "better"
- Assumptions: "everyone knows", "obviously"
- Scope: "all", "never", "always"
- Priority conflicts

### Clarification Questions

| Question Type | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| Definition | "What do you mean by 'user-friendly'?" |
| Boundary | "What's included? What's excluded?" |
| Example | "Can you give me a specific example?" |
| Contrast | "How is this different from X?" |
| Metric | "How would we measure success?" |

### Template
```
"When you say [TERM], do you mean:
a) [Interpretation A]
b) [Interpretation B]
c) Something else?"
```

---

## Mode 4: Validation

### Validation Checklist

```
Before proceeding, confirm:
□ I understand the problem correctly
□ I know the success criteria
□ I've identified constraints
□ I've prioritized requirements
□ Stakeholder agrees with my summary
```

### Validation Prompts
- "Let me summarize to make sure I understand..."
- "Is this what you meant by...?"
- "Did I miss anything important?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how well did I capture your needs?"

### Written Validation
Send summary email after meetings:
```
Subject: Summary - [Meeting Topic]

Key points:
1. [Problem/Need]
2. [Success criteria]
3. [Constraints]
4. [Next steps]

Please confirm this is accurate.
```

---

## Mode 5: Socratic

### Socratic Question Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Clarifying** | Understand | "What do you mean by...?" |
| **Assumption** | Challenge | "What are you assuming here?" |
| **Evidence** | Validate | "What evidence supports this?" |
| **Perspective** | Expand | "How would [X] view this?" |
| **Implication** | Explore | "What would happen if...?" |
| **Question** | Meta | "Why do you think I asked that?" |

### When to Use Socratic
- Uncovering hidden assumptions
- Testing the depth of understanding
- Exploring complex problems
- Helping stakeholders think through issues

### Example Dialogue

```
Stakeholder: "We need real-time sync"
You: "What do you mean by 'real-time'?" (Clarifying)
S: "Instant updates when data changes"
You: "What's driving that requirement?" (Assumption)
S: "Users complain about stale data"
You: "How stale? Minutes? Hours?" (Evidence)
S: "Actually... I think a few minutes would be fine"
You: "What would happen if we sync every 5 minutes?" (Implication)
S: "That could work, and it's much simpler"
```

## Stakeholder Mapping

### Power/Interest Grid

```
          HIGH POWER
               |
   Keep        |    Manage
   Satisfied   |    Closely
               |
    -----------+------------
               |
   Monitor     |    Keep
   (Minimal)   |    Informed
               |
          HIGH INTEREST
```

### Communication by Quadrant

| Quadrant | Strategy | Frequency |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Manage Closely | Regular 1-on-1s, involve in decisions | Weekly |
| Keep Satisfied | Summary updates, escalate issues | Bi-weekly |
| Keep Informed | Status reports, newsletters | Monthly |
| Monitor | Available on request | As needed |

---

## Difficult Stakeholder Types

| Type | Behavior | Strategy |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Silent** | Won't share | Direct questions, written input |
| **Dominant** | Talks over others | Time-box, round robin |
| **Negative** | Shoots down ideas | "Yes, and..." not "No, but..." |
| **Absent** | Misses meetings | Async input, summary emails |
| **Changing** | Shifts requirements | Written confirmation, change log |
