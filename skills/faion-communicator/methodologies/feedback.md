# Giving & Receiving Feedback

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | feedback |
| **Category** | Communication |
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Tags** | feedback, coaching, performance, growth |
| **Skill** | faion-communicator |

## The Problem

Most feedback is either too vague ("good job!") or too harsh ("this is wrong"). Neither helps people improve.

---

## SBI Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact)

### The Formula

```
Situation: "In [specific context]..."
Behavior: "When you [observable action]..."
Impact: "The result was [effect on you/team/project]..."
```

### Example

```
Situation: "In yesterday's client meeting..."
Behavior: "When you interrupted the client twice..."
Impact: "The client seemed frustrated and we lost momentum."
```

### Why It Works
- **Specific** - Not vague generalization
- **Observable** - Behavior, not personality
- **Objective** - Impact, not judgment

---

## SBII (SBI + Intent Inquiry)

Add a fourth step to open dialogue:

```
Situation → Behavior → Impact → Intent
```

### Intent Question
"Help me understand what you were trying to do?"

### Example

```
"In the code review (S), when you approved without comments (B),
I was surprised because that PR had several issues (I).
Can you help me understand your thinking? (Intent)"
```

This avoids assuming malice when there might be a good reason.

## Radical Candor

Kim Scott's framework for feedback that's both kind AND clear:

```
            CHALLENGE DIRECTLY
                    |
    Obnoxious       |    Radical
    Aggression      |    Candor ← GOAL
   (Harsh, hurtful) |  (Kind & clear)
                    |
    -------- CARE PERSONALLY --------
                    |
    Manipulative    |    Ruinous
    Insincerity     |    Empathy
   (Passive-aggr.)  |  (Too nice)
                    |
```

### Quadrant Descriptions

| Quadrant | What It Looks Like |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Radical Candor** | "I care about your growth, and this needs to change" |
| **Ruinous Empathy** | "It's fine..." (when it's not) |
| **Obnoxious Aggression** | "This is garbage, what were you thinking?" |
| **Manipulative Insincerity** | Talking behind back, passive-aggressive |

### How to Be Radically Candid

1. **Start with care** - Genuinely want them to succeed
2. **Be specific** - Use SBI model
3. **Be immediate** - Don't wait for reviews
4. **Be private** - Praise public, criticize private
5. **Ask first** - "Can I give you some feedback?"

## EEC Model (for positive feedback)

```
Example: "When you led the demo yesterday..."
Effect: "The client was impressed and asked for a proposal..."
Continue: "Keep doing this - it's exactly what we need."
```

Makes positive feedback specific and actionable.

## Receiving Feedback Well

### The LEARN Framework

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **L**isten | Don't defend, just absorb |
| **E**xplore | Ask for specific examples |
| **A**cknowledge | Thank them for the effort |
| **R**eflect | Consider validity privately |
| **N**ext | Make changes or explain why not |

### Scripts for Receiving

| Situation | Say |
|-----------|-----|
| Unclear feedback | "Can you give me a specific example?" |
| Disagreeing | "I see it differently. Can we discuss?" |
| Feeling attacked | "I need a moment to process this" |
| Agreeing | "You're right, I'll work on that" |
| Needing time | "Let me think about this and get back to you" |

### Don't Say

- "Yes, but..."
- "You don't understand..."
- "Everyone else does it this way..."
- "That's not fair..."

---

## Feedback Timing

| Type | When |
|------|------|
| **Immediate** | Right after (if possible) |
| **Regular** | Weekly 1-on-1s |
| **Formal** | Quarterly/annual reviews |

### The 2-Minute Rule
If feedback takes less than 2 minutes to give, do it now.

---

## Templates

### Positive Feedback

```
"Hey [Name], quick positive feedback:

In [SITUATION], when you [BEHAVIOR],
it [POSITIVE IMPACT].

Keep it up!"
```

### Constructive Feedback

```
"[Name], do you have 5 minutes? I have some feedback.

In [SITUATION], when you [BEHAVIOR],
the impact was [NEGATIVE EFFECT].

Going forward, could you [ALTERNATIVE BEHAVIOR]?
What do you think?"
```

### Asking for Feedback

```
"I'm working on improving [AREA].
Could you give me feedback on [SPECIFIC THING]?
What's one thing I could do differently?"
```

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "You're [adjective]" | Describe behavior, not person |
| Feedback sandwich | Direct, clear, respectful |
| Waiting too long | Give feedback within 48 hours |
| Public criticism | Always private |
| Vague praise | Specific + impact |
| No follow-up | Check in on progress |

---

## Feedback for Different Situations

### Code Review

```
Instead of: "This is bad code"
Say: "This function is 80 lines (S). When I tried to understand it (B),
I spent 20 minutes and still wasn't sure what it does (I).
Could we extract some helper functions?"
```

### Presentation

```
Instead of: "Good presentation"
Say: "When you opened with the customer story (S/B),
I immediately understood why this matters (I).
That hook was really effective - use it again."
```

### Missing Deadline

```
Instead of: "You're unreliable"
Say: "The feature was delivered Thursday instead of Tuesday (S/B).
The QA team had to work overtime, and we almost missed the release (I).
What blocked you? How can we prevent this?"
```
