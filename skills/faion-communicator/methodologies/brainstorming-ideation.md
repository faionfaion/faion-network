## The Problem

Teams struggle to generate creative solutions because:
- Dominant voices overshadow quiet contributors
- Criticism kills ideas before they develop
- "We've always done it this way" blocks innovation
- No structure leads to unfocused rambling
- Good ideas get lost without proper capture

---

## Core Principles

### Osborn's 4 Rules of Brainstorming

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Defer judgment** | No criticism during idea generation |
| **Go for quantity** | More ideas = better chance of great ones |
| **Encourage wild ideas** | Crazy ideas often lead to breakthroughs |
| **Build on others' ideas** | "Yes, and..." instead of "No, but..." |

### When to Use Each Technique

| Technique | Best For | Group Size |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Classic Brainstorm | Quick idea generation | 4-8 |
| Brainwriting (6-3-5) | Introverts, remote teams | 6 |
| SCAMPER | Improving existing products | 1-6 |
| Mind Mapping | Complex topics, connections | 1-4 |
| Reverse Brainstorm | Problem-solving, risk analysis | 4-8 |
| Round Robin | Equal participation | 4-10 |
| Starbursting | Question generation | 3-6 |

---

## Technique 1: Classic Brainstorming

### Process

```
1. Define Problem (5 min)
   ↓
2. Warm-up Exercise (5 min)
   ↓
3. Generate Ideas (15-20 min)
   ↓
4. Cluster Similar Ideas (10 min)
   ↓
5. Vote/Prioritize (10 min)
```

### Facilitator Script

```
OPENING:
"We're brainstorming [TOPIC]. Remember:
- No criticism - all ideas are valid
- Build on others' ideas
- Go for quantity
- Wild ideas welcome

Our goal: Generate [NUMBER] ideas in [TIME] minutes."

DURING:
- "Great, what else?"
- "Let's build on that..."
- "What if we combined...?"
- [Silence] "Take 30 seconds to think quietly, then share."

CLOSING:
"We generated [X] ideas. Now let's cluster similar ones."
```

---

## Technique 2: Brainwriting (6-3-5)

**6** people write **3** ideas in **5** minutes, then pass papers.

### Process

```
Round 1: Each person writes 3 ideas (5 min)
         ↓ Pass paper to right
Round 2: Read ideas, add 3 more building on them (5 min)
         ↓ Pass paper to right
Round 3-6: Repeat until papers return
         ↓
Result: 108 ideas in 30 minutes (6 people × 3 ideas × 6 rounds)
```

### Template

```
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|     Idea 1       |     Idea 2       |     Idea 3       |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| Round 1:         |                  |                  |
|                  |                  |                  |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| Round 2:         |                  |                  |
|                  |                  |                  |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| Round 3:         |                  |                  |
|                  |                  |                  |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
```

### Benefits
- Equal participation (introverts thrive)
- No interruptions
- Ideas build on each other
- Works great remotely (shared docs)

## Technique 3: SCAMPER

Systematic creativity by applying 7 lenses to existing ideas/products.

| Letter | Action | Question |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **S** | Substitute | What can we replace? (materials, people, process) |
| **C** | Combine | What can we merge? (features, ideas, functions) |
| **A** | Adapt | What can we copy from elsewhere? |
| **M** | Modify | What can we change? (size, shape, color, frequency) |
| **P** | Put to other uses | How else can this be used? |
| **E** | Eliminate | What can we remove? What's not necessary? |
| **R** | Reverse/Rearrange | What if we did opposite? Changed order? |

### Example: Improving Coffee Shop

| Lens | Ideas |
|------|-------|
| **S**ubstitute | Plant-based milk default, robot baristas |
| **C**ombine | Coffee + coworking, Coffee + laundry |
| **A**dapt | Copy hotel concierge service, airline loyalty |
| **M**odify | 24/7 hours, tiny/huge cups, subscription model |
| **P**ut to other uses | Evening wine bar, podcast studio rental |
| **E**liminate | No cash, no menu (AI recommends), no seating |
| **R**everse | Customers make own coffee, mobile shop comes to you |

---

## Technique 4: Mind Mapping

Visual brainstorming that shows connections between ideas.

### Structure

```
                    [BRANCH 2]
                   /    |    \
                  /     |     \
    [BRANCH 1]---[CENTRAL TOPIC]---[BRANCH 3]
                  \     |     /
                   \    |    /
                    [BRANCH 4]
                         |
                    sub-branches
```

### Process

1. **Center:** Write main topic in middle
2. **Branches:** Add main themes radiating out
3. **Sub-branches:** Add details to each branch
4. **Connections:** Draw links between related ideas
5. **Colors:** Use different colors for different themes

### Digital Tools
- Miro, Mural (collaborative)
- MindMeister, XMind (dedicated)
- FigJam, Whimsical (design-focused)

---

## Technique 5: Reverse Brainstorming

Instead of "How to solve?" ask "How to cause the problem?"

### Process

```
1. State problem: "How to increase customer satisfaction?"
   ↓
2. Reverse it: "How to make customers HATE us?"
   ↓
3. Brainstorm bad ideas:
   - Long hold times
   - Rude staff
   - Hidden fees
   - Complicated returns
   ↓
4. Reverse solutions:
   - Callback system
   - Empathy training
   - Transparent pricing
   - Easy returns
```

### Best For
- Identifying risks
- Breaking mental blocks
- Finding non-obvious problems
- Making discussions fun

---

## Technique 6: Round Robin

Ensures everyone contributes equally.

### Process

```
1. Pose question to group
2. Go around table, each person shares ONE idea
3. "Pass" is allowed (but person must contribute next round)
4. Continue rounds until ideas exhausted
5. All ideas visible (whiteboard/sticky notes)
```

### Rules
- No interrupting during someone's turn
- No commenting until round complete
- Short contributions (1-2 sentences)
- Build rounds: "Add to any previous idea"

---

## Technique 7: Starbursting

Question-focused brainstorming using 5W+H.

### Template

```
                    WHO?
                   /    \
                  /      \
            WHEN?----[IDEA]----WHAT?
                  \      /
                   \    /
                   WHERE?
                     |
                    WHY?
                     |
                    HOW?
```

### Example: New Mobile App

| Question | Brainstormed Questions |
|----------|------------------------|
| **WHO** | Who are the users? Who pays? Who maintains? |
| **WHAT** | What problem does it solve? What features are essential? |
| **WHERE** | Where will users use it? Where is data stored? |
| **WHEN** | When do users need it? When to launch? |
| **WHY** | Why would users choose us? Why now? |
| **HOW** | How to monetize? How to acquire users? |

### Use When
- Starting new projects
- Planning research
- Identifying unknowns
- Preparing for decisions

## Facilitation Best Practices

### Before Session

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Define objective | Clear, specific question to answer |
| Select technique | Match to group and goal |
| Prepare materials | Sticky notes, markers, timer, whiteboard |
| Set ground rules | Share Osborn's 4 rules |
| Invite right people | Diverse perspectives, 4-8 ideal |

### During Session

| Phase | Facilitator Actions |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Opening** | State objective, time, rules |
| **Warm-up** | Quick exercise to loosen thinking |
| **Generate** | Encourage quantity, no judgment |
| **Energy dip** | Change technique, take break |
| **Cluster** | Group similar ideas together |
| **Prioritize** | Dot voting or ranking |

### Common Problems & Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Dominant talker | Use brainwriting, round robin |
| Criticism creeping in | "Hold that thought for evaluation phase" |
| Running out of ideas | Apply SCAMPER, change perspective |
| Off-topic drift | "Parking lot" for unrelated ideas |
| Group too quiet | Individual writing first, then share |

---

## Convergence: From Ideas to Action

After divergent brainstorming, converge:

### Dot Voting
- Each person gets 3-5 dots
- Vote on favorite ideas
- Top voted move forward

### Impact/Effort Matrix

```
        HIGH IMPACT
             |
   Quick     |   Major
   Wins      |   Projects
             |
    ---------+---------
             |
   Fill-ins  |   Time
   (maybe)   |   Sinks
             |
        LOW IMPACT
   LOW EFFORT    HIGH EFFORT
```

### Idea Scoring

| Criteria | Weight | Idea 1 | Idea 2 | Idea 3 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Impact | 3x | | | |
| Feasibility | 2x | | | |
| Cost | 2x | | | |
| Time | 1x | | | |
| **Total** | | | | |
