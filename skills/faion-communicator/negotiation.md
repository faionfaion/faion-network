## The Problem

Most people negotiate positions ("I want X") instead of interests ("I need X because..."). This leads to win-lose outcomes and damaged relationships.

---

## Principled Negotiation (Getting to Yes)

### Four Principles

| Principle | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Separate people from problem** | Attack issue, not person |
| **Focus on interests, not positions** | Ask "Why?" behind demands |
| **Generate options for mutual gain** | Brainstorm before deciding |
| **Use objective criteria** | Market rates, precedent, expert opinion |

### Positions vs Interests

```
POSITION: "I need a 20% raise"
INTEREST: "I need to feel valued and afford my mortgage"

POSITION: "Deadline is non-negotiable"
INTEREST: "I need predictability for downstream planning"
```

Finding interests opens creative solutions:
- Title change instead of raise
- Flexible deadline with milestone check-ins

---

## BATNA

**B**est **A**lternative **T**o **N**egotiated **A**greement

### Know Your BATNA

Before negotiating, answer:
- What happens if we don't reach agreement?
- What are my other options?
- What's my walk-away point?

### Strengthen Your BATNA

```
Weak BATNA: "I need this job, I have no other offers"
Strong BATNA: "I have two other offers and can freelance"
```

The better your BATNA, the more power you have.

### Understand Their BATNA

- What happens to them if no deal?
- How urgent is their need?
- What are their alternatives?

---

## ZOPA

**Z**one **O**f **P**ossible **A**greement

```
You:    [Walk Away]----[Target]----[Aspiration]
             $80K         $95K         $110K

Them:   [Aspiration]----[Target]----[Walk Away]
             $75K         $90K         $105K

ZOPA:              [$80K ←→ $105K]
```

If ZOPAs don't overlap, no deal is possible.

## Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion

| Principle | How It Works | Application |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Reciprocity** | Give first | Offer value before asking |
| **Commitment** | Small yes → big yes | Start with minor agreements |
| **Social Proof** | Others do it | "Other clients chose..." |
| **Authority** | Experts convince | Cite credentials, data |
| **Liking** | We say yes to friends | Find common ground |
| **Scarcity** | Limited = valuable | "Only 2 slots left" |

### Examples

**Reciprocity:**
"Here's a free consultation to understand your needs."
→ They feel obligated to consider your proposal.

**Commitment:**
"Do you agree quality is important?"
"Do you agree our approach improves quality?"
"So shall we proceed?"

**Social Proof:**
"Companies like [SIMILAR COMPANY] saw 40% improvement."

## Negotiation Tactics

### Anchoring
First number sets the range. Anchor high (if selling) or low (if buying).

```
Selling: "Similar solutions cost $100-150K" → Anchors at high end
Buying: "Our budget is $50K" → Anchors at low end
```

### Silence
After making an offer, stop talking. Discomfort makes people concede.

### The Flinch
React with surprise to their first offer:
"Wow, that's higher than I expected. How did you arrive at that?"

### Bracketing
If you want $90K and they offer $80K, counter with $100K.
Middle ground ($90K) is your target.

### The Nibble
After main agreement, ask for small extras:
"Since we're agreeing on $95K, could you also include..."

---

## Handling Common Situations

### "Take It or Leave It"

```
Response: "I understand this is your position. Help me understand
the constraints that led to it. Maybe we can find another way
to meet your needs while also addressing mine."
```

### Aggressive Tactics

```
If they attack personally: "Let's focus on the problem, not each other"
If they make threats: "I hear your frustration. What would need to
change for us to find a solution?"
If they walk out: Let them. Call back later: "I'd like to continue
our discussion when you're ready."
```

### Price Objection

```
"Too expensive" → "Compared to what?"
"Over budget" → "What is your budget?"
"Competitor is cheaper" → "What else is different?"
```

### Research First

1. EXPRESS ENTHUSIASM
"I'm excited about this opportunity..."

2. STATE YOUR VALUE
"Based on my [EXPERIENCE/SKILLS]..."

3. CITE DATA
"My research shows similar roles pay $X-Y..."

4. MAKE THE ASK
"I'm looking for [SPECIFIC NUMBER] to accept."

5. SILENCE
[Wait for response]
```

### If They Say No

```
"I understand. Can you help me understand what would
need to be true for us to reach [NUMBER]?

What about:
- Sign-on bonus?
- Earlier review cycle?
- Additional equity?
- Remote work flexibility?"
```
