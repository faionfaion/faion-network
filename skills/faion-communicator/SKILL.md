## M-COM-001: Active Listening

### The Problem
People don't feel heard → resistance, missing information, poor decisions.

### RASA Framework
| Step | Action | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **R**eceive | Pay full attention | No multitasking, eye contact |
| **A**ppreciate | Show you're listening | Nodding, "I see", "Go on" |
| **S**ummarize | Reflect back | "So what you're saying is..." |
| **A**sk | Probe deeper | "Can you tell me more about...?" |

### Key Techniques
- **Paraphrasing:** "If I understand correctly, you mean..."
- **Mirroring:** Repeat last 1-3 words as question
- **Silence:** Pause 3-5 seconds after speaker finishes
- **Open questions:** "What", "How", "Tell me about"

---

## M-COM-002: The Mom Test

### The Problem
People lie when you ask about your idea. They want to be polite.

### Three Rules
1. **Talk about their life, not your idea**
2. **Ask about specifics in the past, not generics about the future**
3. **Talk less, listen more**

### Good vs Bad Questions

| Bad Question | Why Bad | Good Alternative |
|--------------|---------|------------------|
| "Do you think this is a good idea?" | Opinion, not fact | "How do you currently solve this?" |
| "Would you buy this?" | Hypothetical | "When did you last pay for a solution?" |
| "Would you use this feature?" | Future prediction | "Tell me about the last time you had this problem" |

### Commitment Over Compliments
Real validation = commitment (time, money, reputation), not "sounds cool!"

| Compliment (Worthless) | Commitment (Valuable) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| "I would definitely use this" | "Can I be a beta tester?" |
| "Great idea!" | "Here's $50 deposit" |
| "Let me know when it launches" | "I'll introduce you to our CTO" |

---

## M-COM-003: Stakeholder Communication

### Five Dialogue Modes

| Mode | When | Technique |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Interview** | Gathering requirements | Open questions, probing |
| **Brainstorm** | Generating options | Diverge → Cluster → Converge |
| **Clarification** | Resolving ambiguity | Paraphrase, boundary questions |
| **Validation** | Confirming understanding | Summarize, seek confirmation |
| **Socratic** | Deep exploration | Question assumptions |

### Interview Protocol
```
1. Context: "What's the current situation?"
2. Problem: "What problem are you facing?"
3. Impact: "How does this affect you/business?"
4. Goal: "What would success look like?"
5. Constraints: "Any limitations I should know?"
6. Priority: "What's most important?"
```

### Socratic Questions
- Clarifying: "What do you mean by...?"
- Assumption: "What are you assuming?"
- Evidence: "What evidence supports this?"
- Perspective: "How would [X] view this?"
- Implication: "What would happen if...?"

## M-COM-004: Conflict Resolution

### Thomas-Kilmann 5 Modes

```
                    ASSERTIVE
                        |
            Competing   |   Collaborating
           (I win)      |   (We both win)
                        |
    -------- Compromising --------
                        |
            Avoiding    |   Accommodating
           (No one wins)|   (You win)
                        |
                   COOPERATIVE
```

| Mode | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Competing** | Emergency, unpopular decision needed |
| **Collaborating** | Important issue, need buy-in |
| **Compromising** | Moderate importance, time pressure |
| **Avoiding** | Trivial issue, need cooling off |
| **Accommodating** | You're wrong, relationship > issue |

### Nonviolent Communication (NVC)
Marshall Rosenberg's 4 steps:

1. **Observation** (not evaluation): "When I see/hear [specific behavior]..."
2. **Feeling** (not thought): "I feel [emotion]..."
3. **Need** (not strategy): "Because I need [universal need]..."
4. **Request** (not demand): "Would you be willing to [specific action]?"

**Example:**
- Bad: "You're always late to meetings!"
- NVC: "When you arrived 15 minutes late today (O), I felt frustrated (F) because I need to use our time efficiently (N). Would you be willing to text me if you're running late? (R)"

---

## M-COM-005: Giving & Receiving Feedback

### SBI Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact)
```
Situation: "In yesterday's client meeting..."
Behavior: "When you interrupted the client twice..."
Impact: "The client seemed frustrated and we lost momentum."
```

### SBII (with Intent inquiry)
Add: "Help me understand your intention?"
→ Opens dialogue, avoids assumptions

### Radical Candor

```
            CHALLENGE DIRECTLY
                    |
    Obnoxious       |    Radical
    Aggression      |    Candor ← GOAL
   (Harsh, hurtful) |  (Kind & clear)
                    |
    -------- CARE PERSONALLY --------
                    |
    Manipulative    |    Ruinous
    Insincerity     |    Empathy
   (Passive-aggr.)  |  (Too nice)
                    |
```

### Receiving Feedback
1. **Listen** - Don't defend, just absorb
2. **Clarify** - Ask for specific examples
3. **Thank** - Acknowledge the effort to help you
4. **Reflect** - Consider validity privately
5. **Act** - Make changes or explain why not

---

## M-COM-006: Selling Ideas

### SPIN Selling (Neil Rackham)

| Question Type | Purpose | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **S**ituation | Understand context | "How do you currently handle X?" |
| **P**roblem | Uncover pain | "What challenges do you face with X?" |
| **I**mplication | Amplify pain | "What happens if this isn't solved?" |
| **N**eed-Payoff | Lead to solution | "How would it help if you could...?" |

### Challenger Sale
Don't just solve problems - teach something new:

1. **Teach** - Share insight they don't have
2. **Tailor** - Connect to their specific situation
3. **Take Control** - Guide the conversation

### Elevator Pitch Formula
```
For [target customer]
Who [has this problem]
Our [product/idea]
Is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [competitors]
We [unique differentiator]
```

---

## M-COM-007: Business Storytelling

### Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto)
Lead with the answer, then support:

```
         [MAIN POINT]
              |
    ┌─────────┼─────────┐
    ↓         ↓         ↓
[Argument] [Argument] [Argument]
    |         |         |
 Evidence  Evidence  Evidence
```

### SCQA Framework
| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **S**ituation | Establish context | "We're growing 20% YoY" |
| **C**omplication | Introduce tension | "But churn is eating profits" |
| **Q**uestion | Create curiosity | "How do we retain customers?" |
| **A**nswer | Provide solution | "Implement loyalty program" |

### Pixar Framework
```
Once upon a time, there was [SITUATION].
Every day, [ROUTINE].
One day, [CHANGE].
Because of that, [CONSEQUENCE 1].
Because of that, [CONSEQUENCE 2].
Until finally, [RESOLUTION].
```

**Business Example:**
"Once upon a time, our team spent 10 hours/week on manual reporting.
Every day, they copy-pasted data between spreadsheets.
One day, we implemented automated dashboards.
Because of that, reporting time dropped to 1 hour.
Because of that, the team focused on analysis, not data entry.
Until finally, we identified $500K in cost savings."

## M-COM-008: Negotiation & Persuasion

### Principled Negotiation (Getting to Yes)
| Principle | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Separate people from problem | Attack issue, not person |
| Focus on interests, not positions | Ask "Why?" behind demands |
| Generate options for mutual gain | Brainstorm before deciding |
| Use objective criteria | Market rates, precedent, expert opinion |

### BATNA
**B**est **A**lternative **T**o **N**egotiated **A**greement

Know your walkaway point before negotiating.

### Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Reciprocity** | Give first, then ask |
| **Commitment** | Get small yes, then bigger |
| **Social Proof** | "Others like you chose..." |
| **Authority** | Show expertise, credentials |
| **Liking** | Find common ground |
| **Scarcity** | Limited time/availability |

---

## M-COM-009: Difficult Conversations

### Crucial Conversations Framework
When stakes are high, opinions differ, emotions run strong:

1. **Start with Heart** - What do I really want?
2. **Learn to Look** - Notice when safety is at risk
3. **Make it Safe** - Establish mutual purpose
4. **Master My Stories** - Separate facts from interpretation
5. **STATE My Path** - Share, Tell, Ask, Talk, Encourage
6. **Explore Others' Paths** - Listen actively
7. **Move to Action** - Who does what by when?

### DESC Script
For assertive confrontation:

| Step | Template |
|------|----------|
| **D**escribe | "When [specific behavior]..." |
| **E**xpress | "I feel [emotion]..." |
| **S**pecify | "I would like [specific change]..." |
| **C**onsequences | "If this changes, [positive]. If not, [negative]." |

### Safety Signals
Watch for:
- **Silence** - Withdrawing, avoiding, masking
- **Violence** - Controlling, labeling, attacking

When you see these → Restore safety before continuing.
