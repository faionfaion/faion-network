## The Problem

People lie when you ask about your idea. They want to be polite.

Your mom will say "That's a great idea, honey!" even if it's terrible.

---

## Three Rules

### Rule 1: Talk about their life, not your idea
Ask about their problems, not your solution.

### Rule 2: Ask about specifics in the past, not generics about the future
Past behavior predicts future behavior. Hypotheticals are worthless.

### Rule 3: Talk less, listen more
If you're talking more than 20%, you're pitching, not learning.

## Good vs Bad Questions

| Bad Question | Why Bad | Good Alternative |
|--------------|---------|------------------|
| "Do you think this is a good idea?" | Opinion, not fact | "How do you currently solve this?" |
| "Would you buy this?" | Hypothetical | "When did you last pay for a solution?" |
| "Would you use this feature?" | Future prediction | "Tell me about the last time you had this problem" |
| "How much would you pay?" | Imaginary money | "What do you currently spend on this?" |
| "Do you have this problem?" | Leading question | "Walk me through your workflow" |

---

## Commitment Over Compliments

Real validation = commitment (time, money, reputation), not "sounds cool!"

| Compliment (Worthless) | Commitment (Valuable) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| "I would definitely use this" | "Can I be a beta tester?" |
| "Great idea!" | "Here's $50 deposit" |
| "Let me know when it launches" | "I'll introduce you to our CTO" |
| "We need something like this" | "Can we schedule a pilot next month?" |
| "Interesting concept" | "I'll send you our requirements doc" |

### Commitment Escalation

```
Time commitment → Reputation commitment → Money commitment
     (meeting)        (introduction)         (prepay)
```

---

## The Deflection Script

When asked "What do you think of my idea?":

```
"Thanks for asking! But first, help me understand...
- Have you experienced [problem] recently?
- What happened?
- What did you do about it?"
```

---

## Interview Template

### Opening (2 min)

## Red Flags in Interviews

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| "I would..." | Hypothetical, not real |
| "I usually..." | Generic, probe for specific |
| "I think..." | Opinion, not behavior |
| Compliments | Politeness, not validation |
| No follow-up questions from them | Low interest |
| Vague answers | Haven't actually experienced it |

---

## Data Points to Collect

| Category | Questions |
|----------|-----------|
| **Problem** | Do they have it? How often? How severe? |
| **Current solution** | What do they use now? Why? |
| **Willingness to pay** | Have they paid for solutions before? |
| **Decision process** | Who decides? How long? What criteria? |
| **Urgency** | Active vs passive searching? |

---

## After the Interview

### Process Notes
1. Write down exact quotes (not paraphrases)
2. Highlight: Problems, current solutions, commitments
3. Rate: Strong signal / Weak signal / No signal
4. Update: Problem hypothesis, solution hypothesis

### Pattern Recognition
After 5+ interviews, look for:
- Repeated problems (3+ mentions)
- Similar workarounds
- Common frustrations
- Surprising insights

## Common Mistakes
