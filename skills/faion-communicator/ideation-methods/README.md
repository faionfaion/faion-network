## Overview

Structured ideation methods for systematic creativity. While brainstorming techniques focus on group facilitation, these methods provide frameworks for generating and developing ideas.

### When to Use Each Method

| Method | Best For | Group Size |
|--------|----------|------------|
| SCAMPER | Improving existing products | 1-6 |
| Mind Mapping | Complex topics, connections | 1-4 |
| Starbursting | Question generation | 3-6 |

---

## Method 1: SCAMPER

Systematic creativity by applying 7 lenses to existing ideas/products.

| Letter | Action | Question |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **S** | Substitute | What can we replace? (materials, people, process) |
| **C** | Combine | What can we merge? (features, ideas, functions) |
| **A** | Adapt | What can we copy from elsewhere? |
| **M** | Modify | What can we change? (size, shape, color, frequency) |
| **P** | Put to other uses | How else can this be used? |
| **E** | Eliminate | What can we remove? What's not necessary? |
| **R** | Reverse/Rearrange | What if we did opposite? Changed order? |

### Example: Improving Coffee Shop

| Lens | Ideas |
|------|-------|
| **S**ubstitute | Plant-based milk default, robot baristas |
| **C**ombine | Coffee + coworking, Coffee + laundry |
| **A**dapt | Copy hotel concierge service, airline loyalty |
| **M**odify | 24/7 hours, tiny/huge cups, subscription model |
| **P**ut to other uses | Evening wine bar, podcast studio rental |
| **E**liminate | No cash, no menu (AI recommends), no seating |
| **R**everse | Customers make own coffee, mobile shop comes to you |

### Process

```
1. Select product/service to improve
   ↓
2. Apply each SCAMPER lens (5-10 min per lens)
   ↓
3. Generate 3-5 ideas per lens
   ↓
4. Combine best ideas
   ↓
5. Prototype top concepts
```

### SCAMPER Question Bank

**Substitute:**
- What materials can we replace?
- What process can we substitute?
- What rules can we change?
- Who else could do this?

**Combine:**
- What features can we merge?
- What audiences can we unite?
- What can we bundle?
- What partnerships are possible?

**Adapt:**
- What does a similar industry do?
- What worked in the past?
- What can we copy and improve?
- What nature solution applies?

**Modify:**
- What can we make bigger/smaller?
- What can we make faster/slower?
- What shape/color changes work?
- What frequency changes help?

**Put to Other Uses:**
- Who else needs this?
- What other markets exist?
- What repurposing is possible?
- What byproducts have value?

**Eliminate:**
- What's not essential?
- What's redundant?
- What rules can we break?
- What can we simplify?

**Reverse/Rearrange:**
- What if we did the opposite?
- What if we changed the sequence?
- What if roles reversed?
- What if we flipped the model?

## Method 2: Mind Mapping

Visual ideation that shows connections between ideas.

### Structure

```
                    [BRANCH 2]
                   /    |    \
                  /     |     \
    [BRANCH 1]---[CENTRAL TOPIC]---[BRANCH 3]
                  \     |     /
                   \    |    /
                    [BRANCH 4]
                         |
                    sub-branches
```

### Process

1. **Center:** Write main topic in middle
2. **Branches:** Add main themes radiating out
3. **Sub-branches:** Add details to each branch
4. **Connections:** Draw links between related ideas
5. **Colors:** Use different colors for different themes

### Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use single words/short phrases | Write full sentences |
| Add images and icons | Use only text |
| Use colors for themes | Make it black and white |
| Draw connections | Keep ideas isolated |
| Start broad, go specific | Start with details |

### Digital Tools
- Miro, Mural (collaborative)
- MindMeister, XMind (dedicated)
- FigJam, Whimsical (design-focused)

### Example: Product Launch Mind Map

```
                    MARKETING
                   /    |    \
                  /     |     \
    TEAM---[PRODUCT LAUNCH]---TIMELINE
                  \     |     /
                   \    |    /
                    BUDGET
                         |
                    RISKS
```

Each branch expands:
- **TEAM:** Roles, Hiring, Training, Structure
- **MARKETING:** Channels, Content, Partnerships, PR
- **TIMELINE:** Milestones, Dependencies, Deadlines
- **BUDGET:** Costs, Revenue, Funding, ROI
- **RISKS:** Technical, Market, Competition, Legal

## Method 3: Starbursting

### Template

```
                    WHO?
                   /    \
                  /      \
            WHEN?----[IDEA]----WHAT?
                  \      /
                   \    /
                   WHERE?

3. Generate WHAT questions (5 min)
   ↓
4. Generate WHERE, WHEN, WHY, HOW questions (5 min each)
