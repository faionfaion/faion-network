# Business Storytelling

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | business-storytelling |
| **Category** | Communication |
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Tags** | presentations, writing, persuasion, structure |
| **Skill** | faion-communicator |

## The Problem

Data alone doesn't persuade. People remember stories 22x better than facts. Bad structure loses audiences in the first minute.

---

## Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto)

### The Core Idea

Lead with the answer, then support.

```
         [MAIN POINT]
              |
    ┌─────────┼─────────┐
    ↓         ↓         ↓
[Argument] [Argument] [Argument]
    |         |         |
 Evidence  Evidence  Evidence
```

### Why It Works
- Busy people get the point immediately
- They can stop reading when satisfied
- Structure is clear and logical

### Example: Project Proposal

```
MAIN POINT:
"We should migrate to cloud infrastructure"

ARGUMENT 1: Cost reduction
- Evidence: 40% lower TCO analysis
- Evidence: Competitor benchmarks

ARGUMENT 2: Scalability
- Evidence: Current capacity limits
- Evidence: Projected growth

ARGUMENT 3: Speed
- Evidence: Deployment time comparison
- Evidence: Developer survey
```

### MECE Rule
Arguments must be:
- **M**utually **E**xclusive - No overlap
- **C**ollectively **E**xhaustive - Nothing missing

## SCQA Framework

For building narrative tension:

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **S**ituation | Establish context | "We're growing 20% YoY" |
| **C**omplication | Introduce tension | "But churn is eating profits" |
| **Q**uestion | Create curiosity | "How do we retain customers?" |
| **A**nswer | Provide solution | "Implement loyalty program" |

### SCQA Examples

**Product Pitch:**
```
S: "Our team ships 10 features per quarter"
C: "But 30% have critical bugs in the first week"
Q: "How do we maintain velocity while improving quality?"
A: "Automated testing with 80% coverage gate"
```

**Strategy Presentation:**
```
S: "We dominate the SMB market with 60% share"
C: "Enterprise represents 5x larger revenue per customer"
Q: "Should we pursue enterprise, and how?"
A: "Phased approach: mid-market first, then enterprise"
```

## Pixar Framework

The storytelling structure behind every Pixar movie:

```
Once upon a time, there was [SITUATION].
Every day, [ROUTINE].
One day, [CHANGE].
Because of that, [CONSEQUENCE 1].
Because of that, [CONSEQUENCE 2].
Until finally, [RESOLUTION].
```

### Business Application

```
Once upon a time, our team spent 10 hours/week on manual reporting.
Every day, they copy-pasted data between 5 spreadsheets.
One day, we implemented automated dashboards.
Because of that, reporting time dropped to 1 hour.
Because of that, the team focused on analysis, not data entry.
Until finally, we identified $500K in cost savings.
```

### When to Use
- Case studies
- Success stories
- Change initiatives
- Lessons learned

---

## The Hero's Journey (Simplified)

For longer presentations:

```
1. Ordinary World - How things are now
2. Call to Adventure - The opportunity/problem
3. Refusal - Why change is hard
4. Meeting the Mentor - Your solution/approach
5. Crossing the Threshold - Taking action
6. Tests & Allies - Challenges and support
7. The Ordeal - The big challenge
8. The Reward - Success/results
9. The Return - New normal, lessons
```

### Business Version

```
1. Current State - "Today, we do X"
2. Opportunity - "The market is shifting"
3. Resistance - "But change is risky"
4. Solution - "Here's our approach"
5. First Steps - "We'll start with..."
6. Challenges - "We'll face..."
7. Key Milestone - "The critical moment"
8. Benefits - "We'll achieve..."
9. Vision - "This becomes our new normal"
```

## Story Elements That Work

### The Hook (First 30 Seconds)

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Surprising stat | "90% of startups fail. Here's why we won't." |
| Question | "What if you could deploy without fear?" |
| Bold statement | "Meetings are broken. Let me prove it." |
| Story | "Last Tuesday at 2am, our server crashed..." |
| Contradiction | "The best code is no code." |

### Concrete vs Abstract

| Abstract (Weak) | Concrete (Strong) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "Improved efficiency" | "Cut processing time from 4 hours to 15 minutes" |
| "Better customer experience" | "Reduced support tickets by 60%" |
| "Enhanced security" | "Blocked 10,000 attacks last month" |

### Use Analogies

```
"Think of microservices like a restaurant kitchen.
Instead of one chef doing everything,
you have specialists: one for prep, one for grill, one for plating.
If the grill station gets busy, you add another grill cook,
not another full chef."
```

---

## Data Storytelling

### Before/After Structure

```
BEFORE: [Problem state with numbers]
ACTION: [What we did]
AFTER: [Improved state with numbers]
```

### The "So What" Test
For every data point, answer: "So what? Why does this matter?"

```
Bad: "We have 99.9% uptime"
Better: "99.9% uptime means only 8.7 hours of downtime per year"
Best: "99.9% uptime means your customers never see an error page"
```

### Visualize the Contrast

```
OLD WAY:
████████████████████████ 24 hours

NEW WAY:
██ 2 hours
```

## Templates

### Executive Summary

```

```

### Presentation Outline

```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Burying the lead | Answer first, then explain |
| Too much data | 1 point per slide |
| No "so what" | State the implication |
| All logic, no emotion | Add stories, analogies |
| Weak ending | Clear, memorable call to action |
| Reading slides | Slides support, don't replace |
