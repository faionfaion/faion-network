## The Problem

People don't feel heard → resistance, missing information, poor decisions.

---

## RASA Framework

| Step | Action | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **R**eceive | Pay full attention | No multitasking, eye contact |
| **A**ppreciate | Show you're listening | Nodding, "I see", "Go on" |
| **S**ummarize | Reflect back | "So what you're saying is..." |
| **A**sk | Probe deeper | "Can you tell me more about...?" |

---

## Key Techniques

### Paraphrasing
"If I understand correctly, you mean..."

### Mirroring
Repeat last 1-3 words as question.

**Example:**
- Speaker: "We're really struggling with the deployment process."
- You: "The deployment process?"
- Speaker: [elaborates]

### Silence
Pause 3-5 seconds after speaker finishes. People often add important details.

### Open Questions
Use "What", "How", "Tell me about" instead of yes/no questions.

| Closed (Bad) | Open (Good) |
|--------------|-------------|
| "Is the system slow?" | "How does the system perform?" |
| "Do you like the design?" | "What do you think about the design?" |
| "Is that a problem?" | "How does that affect you?" |

## Empathic Listening Levels

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1. Ignoring | Not listening at all | Looking at phone |
| 2. Pretending | "Uh-huh, yeah..." | No real engagement |
| 3. Selective | Hearing only parts | Waiting to respond |
| 4. Attentive | Focusing on words | Taking notes |
| 5. **Empathic** | Understanding feelings | "That sounds frustrating" |

**Goal:** Level 5 - understand both content AND emotion.

---

## Reflective Listening

Reflect both content and feeling:

```
"It sounds like you're [FEELING] because [CONTENT]."
```

**Examples:**
- "It sounds like you're frustrated because the deadline keeps moving."
- "It seems like you're excited about this new approach."
- "I hear that you're concerned about the budget implications."

## Barriers to Active Listening

| Barrier | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Planning response** | Focus on understanding first |
| **Judging** | Suspend judgment until they finish |
| **Interrupting** | Wait 2 seconds after they stop |
| **Advising** | Ask "Do you want advice or just to vent?" |
| **Distractions** | Remove phone, close laptop |
