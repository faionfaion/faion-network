## The Problem

Unresolved conflicts damage relationships, kill productivity, and create toxic environments. Most people avoid conflict, making it worse.

## Thomas-Kilmann 5 Conflict Modes

```
                    ASSERTIVE
                        |
            Competing   |   Collaborating
           (I win)      |   (We both win)
                        |
    -------- Compromising --------
                        |
            Avoiding    |   Accommodating
           (No one wins)|   (You win)
                        |
                   COOPERATIVE
```

### Mode Selection Guide

| Mode | When to Use | When NOT to Use |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Competing** | Emergency, unpopular but right decision, protecting yourself | Routine issues, when you're wrong |
| **Collaborating** | Important issue, need buy-in, time available | Trivial matters, no trust |
| **Compromising** | Moderate importance, equal power, time pressure | When full collaboration possible |
| **Avoiding** | Trivial issue, need cooling off, no chance of winning | Important issue, won't resolve itself |
| **Accommodating** | You're wrong, relationship matters more, building goodwill | Core values at stake, pattern of always giving in |

## Nonviolent Communication (NVC)

Marshall Rosenberg's 4-step framework:

### The Formula

```
When I see/hear [OBSERVATION]...
I feel [FEELING]...
Because I need [NEED]...
Would you be willing to [REQUEST]?
```

### Step 1: Observation (not evaluation)

| Evaluation (Bad) | Observation (Good) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "You're always late" | "You arrived at 9:15 for the 9:00 meeting" |
| "You don't care" | "I haven't received a response to my 3 emails" |
| "The code is messy" | "I found 5 functions over 100 lines" |

### Step 2: Feeling (not thought)

| Thought (Bad) | Feeling (Good) |
|---------------|----------------|
| "I feel like you don't respect me" | "I feel frustrated" |
| "I feel that this is unfair" | "I feel disappointed" |
| "I feel ignored" | "I feel sad and confused" |

**Feeling Words:**
- Positive: glad, relieved, hopeful, excited, grateful
- Negative: frustrated, disappointed, worried, overwhelmed, hurt

### Step 3: Need (universal, not strategy)

| Strategy (Bad) | Need (Good) |
|----------------|-------------|
| "I need you to answer faster" | "I need responsiveness" |
| "I need a bigger team" | "I need support" |
| "I need you to stop micromanaging" | "I need autonomy" |

**Universal Needs:**
- Autonomy, competence, connection
- Safety, predictability, fairness
- Respect, recognition, contribution
- Rest, play, meaning

### Step 4: Request (specific, positive, doable)

| Demand/Vague | Request (Good) |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Be more careful" | "Would you review the checklist before submitting?" |
| "Communicate better" | "Would you send a daily status update?" |
| "Fix this" | "Would you pair with me for 30 min to debug?" |

## NVC Examples

### Example 1: Late Delivery

**Bad:** "You never deliver on time. This is unacceptable."

**NVC:** "When the feature was delivered 3 days after the deadline (O), I felt stressed (F) because I need predictability to plan my work (N). Would you be willing to flag delays 2 days in advance? (R)"

### Example 2: Code Review

**Bad:** "Your code reviews are useless. You just approve everything."

**NVC:** "When I see PRs approved in under 5 minutes (O), I feel worried (F) because I need thoroughness to maintain quality (N). Would you be willing to spend at least 15 minutes on PRs over 100 lines? (R)"

### Example 3: Meetings

**Bad:** "These meetings are a waste of time."

**NVC:** "When meetings run over an hour without an agenda (O), I feel frustrated (F) because I need efficiency to meet my deadlines (N). Could we try 30-minute meetings with agendas sent in advance? (R)"

## De-escalation Techniques

### When Emotions Run High

1. **Pause** - "Let's take 5 minutes and come back"
2. **Acknowledge** - "I can see this is important to you"
3. **Name** - "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated"
4. **Redirect** - "Let's focus on what we can control"

### Phrases That Help

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Calm down" | "I want to understand your perspective" |
| "You're wrong" | "I see it differently, help me understand" |
| "That's not my problem" | "Let's figure out who can help" |
| "Whatever" | "I need time to think about this" |

### Phrases to Avoid

- "You always..." / "You never..."
- "That's ridiculous"
- "Everyone thinks so"
- "With all due respect..."
- "I'm not angry, but..."

## Mediation (Third Party)

When you're facilitating between others:

### Ground Rules
1. One person speaks at a time
2. No interrupting
3. No personal attacks
4. Focus on future, not blame
5. What's said here stays here

### Mediator Script

```
OPENING:
"We're here to find a solution that works for both of you.
I'm not here to judge who's right.
Ground rules: [STATE RULES]"

EXPLORATION:
[To Person A]: "Share your perspective. What happened?"
[To Person B]: "What did you hear? What's your view?"

FINDING COMMON GROUND:
"What do you both agree on?"
"What do you both want to achieve?"

RESOLUTION:
"What would need to happen for this to be resolved?"
"What are you each willing to do?"
```
