# Market Sizing with AI

## Problem

TAM/SAM/SOM estimates are often finger-in-the-air.

## Solution: AI-Assisted Market Sizing

**Top-Down + Bottom-Up Triangulation:**
```
Top-Down:
Market reports -> Industry size -> Segment -> Target
$100B market -> 20% segment -> 5% addressable = $1B

Bottom-Up:
# potential customers x average revenue = TAM
100K companies x $10K/year = $1B

Triangulate: If both approaches give similar numbers, confidence increases.
```
