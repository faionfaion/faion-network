## Problem

Entrepreneurs either ignore competitors ("We're unique!") or obsess over them. Common issues:
- Not knowing who the real competitors are
- Copying instead of differentiating
- Missing indirect competitors
- No systematic tracking of competitor moves

**The root cause:** No structured framework for competitive intelligence.

## Framework

### What is Competitor Analysis?

Competitor analysis is the systematic study of businesses that compete for the same customers. It helps you find gaps, position your offering, and learn from others' mistakes.

### The Competitor Analysis Framework

#### Step 1: Identify Competitors

**Three types:**

| Type | Definition | Example (for CRM) |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| Direct | Same product, same audience | Salesforce, HubSpot |
| Indirect | Different product, same problem | Spreadsheets, Notion |
| Future | Emerging or could pivot | AI startups, big tech |

**Where to find:**
- Google "[problem] solution"
- Product Hunt: search category
- G2/Capterra: browse category
- "Alternatives to [known competitor]"
- Reddit: "What do you use for [problem]?"
- Ask target customers what they use

**Target:** 5-10 direct, 3-5 indirect, 2-3 future

#### Step 2: Map Competitor Landscape

**Positioning Matrix:**

```
                    Premium
                       |
    Specialized    |   Enterprise
    (High Value)   |   (High Price)
    ---------------|----------------
    Niche          |   Mass Market
    (Underserved)  |   (Crowded)
                       |
                    Budget
       Narrow ---------|--------- Broad
                   Feature Set
```

**Your goal:** Find empty quadrants or underserved positions.

#### Step 3: Analyze Each Competitor

**Key dimensions:**

| Dimension | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| Product | What features? What's missing? |
| Pricing | What model? What tiers? |
| Positioning | Who do they target? What's the message? |
| Technology | What stack? What integrations? |
| Traction | How many users? Revenue estimate? |
| Team | Size? Expertise? Funding? |
| Marketing | Channels? Content? Ads? |
| Weaknesses | Bad reviews? Gaps? Slow? |

#### Step 4: Identify Opportunities

**Gap analysis:**

| Category | Competitor A | Competitor B | Your Opportunity |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Feature X | Yes | No | Differentiate |
| Feature Y | Weak | Yes | Do better |
| Audience Z | No | No | Blue ocean |
| Price point | $99/mo | $49/mo | $19/mo tier |

**Opportunity types:**
1. **Feature gap** - They don't have it
2. **Quality gap** - They do it poorly
3. **Audience gap** - They don't serve this segment
4. **Price gap** - They're too expensive for some
5. **Experience gap** - UX/onboarding is painful

#### Step 5: Define Your Differentiation

**Positioning statement:**

```
For [target audience]
Who [need/problem]
[Product name] is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [competitors]
We [key differentiator]
```

**Example:**
```
For solo freelancers
Who need simple project tracking
TaskLite is a project management tool
That focuses on single-person workflows
Unlike Asana or Monday
We have no team features, just personal productivity
```
