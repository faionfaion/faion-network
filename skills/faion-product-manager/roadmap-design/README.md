## Problem

Roadmaps either over-promise specific dates or are so vague they're useless. Common issues:
- Feature lists with dates that always slip
- No connection to strategy or goals
- Stakeholders interpret roadmap as commitment
- No flexibility for learning and change

**The root cause:** Wrong roadmap format for the audience and uncertainty level.

---

## Framework

### What is a Roadmap?

A roadmap is a strategic communication tool that shows what you plan to build and why. It answers: "Where are we going and how will we get there?"

**Key insight:** Roadmaps are about outcomes, not feature lists.

### Roadmap Types

| Type | Focus | Timeframe | Best For |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Timeline | When things ship | Quarters/months | External, committed work |
| Now-Next-Later | Priority sequence | Flexible | Internal, early stage |
| Outcome-based | Goals to achieve | Themes | Strategic alignment |
| Kanban | Current work | Live | Internal teams |

### Roadmap Components

#### 1. Vision

**Where are we heading long-term?**
- 1-3 year vision statement
- Strategic pillars
- Success definition

#### 2. Objectives

**What outcomes are we targeting?**
- OKRs or goals
- Measurable targets
- Timeframes

#### 3. Themes

**What problem areas are we addressing?**
- Group related work
- Connect to objectives
- Provide flexibility

#### 4. Features/Initiatives

**What will we build?**
- High-level descriptions
- Tied to themes
- Confidence levels

### Roadmap Design Process

#### Step 1: Start with Strategy

**Inputs needed:**
- Company/product vision
- Business goals for the period
- User research insights
- Technical constraints

**Output:** Clear objectives for the roadmap period.

#### Step 2: Choose the Format

**Decision factors:**

| Factor | Timeline | Now-Next-Later | Outcome |
|--------|----------|----------------|---------|
| Uncertainty | Low | Medium | High |
| External sharing | Yes | Limited | Yes |
| Commitment level | High | Medium | Low |
| Team maturity | High | Any | Any |

#### Step 3: Define Themes

Group work into 3-5 themes:

**Template:**
```
Theme: [Name]
Objective: [What outcome it drives]
Why now: [Strategic rationale]
Example initiatives: [2-3 examples]
```

#### Step 4: Populate with Work

**For each time horizon/bucket:**
- What are we confident about?
- What are we exploring?
- What did we decide NOT to do?

**Confidence indicators:**
- High: Committed, scoped
- Medium: Planned, needs scoping
- Low: Exploring, tentative

#### Step 5: Add Context

**For stakeholder communication:**
- Why we chose this
- What we're NOT doing
- Dependencies and risks
- How we'll measure success
