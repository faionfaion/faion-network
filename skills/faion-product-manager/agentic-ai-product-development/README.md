## Agentic AI Product Development

### Problem

Traditional AI features are reactive; 2026 demands autonomous systems.

### Solution: Design for Agentic AI

**Agentic AI Characteristics:**

| Traditional AI | Agentic AI |
|----------------|------------|
| Single model | Orchestrated systems |
| User-triggered | Autonomous action |
| Task completion | Goal achievement |
| Static behavior | Learning from results |

**Agentic Product Design Principles:**
```
1. Autonomous First: Solve problems without manual input
2. Goal-Oriented: Define outcomes, not tasks
3. Self-Improving: Learn from every interaction
4. Human-in-Loop: Escalate when uncertain
5. Explainable: Always show reasoning
```

**Building Agentic Products:**

| Phase | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| Define | Set clear outcome goals |
| Design | Map autonomous workflows |
| Build | Implement agent orchestration |
| Monitor | Track goal achievement, not task completion |
| Iterate | Tune behavior, not just features |

**Minimum Viable Intelligence (MVI):**
- Replace MVP with MVI for AI products
- Focus on "intelligence level" not feature count
- Cost range: $50K (MVI) to $500K+ (enterprise autonomous)

**Cost Structure Shift:**
```
Traditional: Development salaries (70%) + Infrastructure (30%)
AI-Native: Infrastructure + Inference (60%) + Development (40%)
```

**Key Insight 2026:** 40% of AI-mature organizations are piloting agentic systems. Model selection (right tool for right job) is critical for cost management.
