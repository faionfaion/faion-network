# Experimentation at Scale

## Problem

Ad-hoc A/B testing doesn't build organizational learning.

## Solution: Enterprise Experimentation Platform

**Experimentation Maturity Levels:**

| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1. Ad-hoc | Individual experiments, no standardization |
| 2. Structured | Defined process, shared tools |
| 3. Scaled | 100+ experiments/year, statistical rigor |
| 4. Culture | Every decision backed by experiment |

**Modern Experimentation Stack 2026:**

| Component | Purpose | Tools |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Feature Flags | Safe rollouts | LaunchDarkly, Statsig |
| A/B Testing | Hypothesis validation | GrowthBook, Amplitude |
| Analytics | Behavioral data | Amplitude, Mixpanel |
| Warehouse | Data integration | Snowflake, BigQuery |

**Experimentation Best Practices:**
```
1. Define hypothesis BEFORE building test
2. Calculate required sample size
3. Set guardrail metrics (not just success metrics)
4. Run sequential testing for faster decisions
5. Document learnings in central repository
6. Share results organization-wide
```

**AI in Experimentation 2026:**
- AI-generated test hypotheses
- Automated variant creation
- Predictive winner detection
- Natural language result summaries

**Scale Benchmarks:**
| Company | Annual Experiments |
|---------|-------------------|
| Microsoft | ~100,000 |
| GoDaddy | 1,700+ |
| Enterprise average | 500-1000 |

**Key Tools Comparison:**

| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| GrowthBook | Developer-first, open source |
| Statsig | Enterprise scale (1T+ events/day) |
| Amplitude | All-in-one analytics + experimentation |
| Eppo | Warehouse-native, statistical rigor |
