# Product Management Best Practices 2026

## M-PRD-019: 9 Minimum Product Frameworks

### Problem

"Just build an MVP" is lazy instruction in 2026.

### Solution: Choose the Right Framework

| Framework | Acronym | Purpose | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Minimum Viable Product | MVP | Test core assumptions | New market, unvalidated idea |
| Minimum Lovable Product | MLP | Create emotional connection | Crowded market, need differentiation |
| Minimum Marketable Product | MMP | Generate revenue | B2B, enterprise sales |
| Minimum Awesome Component | MAC | One killer feature | Feature-based differentiation |
| Riskiest Assumption Test | RAT | Validate biggest risk | High-uncertainty projects |
| Minimum Delightful Product | MDP | Exceed expectations | Premium positioning |
| Minimum Valuable Product | MVA | Deliver business value | Enterprise, ROI-focused |
| Minimum Functional Product | MFP | Technical feasibility | Complex tech, infrastructure |
| Simple, Lovable, Complete | SLC | Balance simplicity + polish | Consumer apps |

**Decision Matrix:**

| Market Condition | Recommended Framework |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Blue ocean, unvalidated | MVP or RAT |
| Red ocean, many competitors | MLP or MAC |
| Enterprise B2B | MMP or MVA |
| Consumer, emotion-driven | MLP or MDP |
| Technical uncertainty | MFP then expand |

**Key Insight 2026:** In crowded markets, MVP can be "suicide" - users already have "good enough" solutions. You need to be "awesome" or "lovable" to switch them.

## M-PRD-020: Micro-MVPs

### Problem

Traditional MVPs still take weeks/months to build.

### Solution: Micro-MVPs

**Definition:** Extremely small, high-signal experiments designed to validate one key assumption at a time.

**Examples:**
| Type | Effort | Validates |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Landing page | 1 day | Demand, messaging |
| Concierge | 1 week | Workflow, value |
| Wizard of Oz | Days | UX, willingness to pay |
| Video demo | Hours | Interest, virality |
| Fake door | Hours | Feature demand |
| Smoke test | Days | Price sensitivity |

**Micro-MVP Process:**
```
1. Identify riskiest assumption
2. Design smallest experiment to test it
3. Define success metrics before starting
4. Run experiment (hours-days)
5. Analyze results
6. Decide: pivot, persevere, or next assumption
```

**Example: Dropbox**
```
Assumption: People want easy file sync
Micro-MVP: 3-minute video explaining concept
Result: Waitlist jumped from 5K to 75K overnight
Cost: Video production time only
```

## M-PRD-021: AI-Native Product Development

### Problem

Building products without AI in 2026 is like building without internet in 2006.

### Solution: AI-First Architecture

**AI Integration Layers:**

| Layer | AI Application |
|-------|----------------|
| Research | AI-powered user research, sentiment analysis |
| Design | AI design tools, prototyping |
| Development | Copilots, code generation |
| Testing | AI test generation, bug detection |
| Analytics | Predictive analytics, anomaly detection |
| Support | AI chatbots, ticket routing |

**AI-Native MVP Pattern:**
```
Traditional: Build feature → Test → Iterate
AI-Native: Define intent → AI generates → Human refines → Test
```

**Key Considerations:**
- EU AI Act compliance from day one
- Explainability requirements
- Bias testing in product development
- Data privacy safeguards

**Build vs Buy (AI Features):**
| Build | Buy/Use API |
|-------|-------------|
| Core differentiator | Commodity AI features |
| Unique data advantage | Standard use cases |
| Long-term moat | Speed to market |

## M-PRD-022: Continuous Discovery

### Problem

Discovery treated as one-time activity at project start.

### Solution: Ongoing Discovery Integration

**Continuous Discovery Habits:**

| Activity | Frequency | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| User interviews | Weekly | Fresh insights |
| Data review | Daily | Behavioral patterns |
| Competitor monitoring | Weekly | Market changes |
| Feature requests analysis | Weekly | Demand signals |
| Support ticket review | Daily | Pain points |

**Integration with Agile:**
```
Sprint Planning: Include discovery tasks
Sprint: Run experiments alongside development
Sprint Review: Share discovery insights
Retrospective: Improve discovery process
```

**Discovery → Delivery Balance:**
- Allocate 15-20% of team capacity to discovery
- Every sprint includes at least one experiment
- Document learnings in central repository
- Share insights across teams

**Tools:**
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Dovetail | Research repository |
| ProductBoard | Feature management |
| Pendo | In-app analytics |
| Hotjar | User behavior |
| Maze | Rapid testing |

## M-PRD-023: Outcome-Based Roadmaps

### Problem

Feature-based roadmaps commit to solutions before validating problems.

### Solution: Outcome-Based Planning

**Feature Roadmap vs Outcome Roadmap:**

| Feature Roadmap | Outcome Roadmap |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "Build chat feature" | "Reduce support tickets by 30%" |
| "Add dark mode" | "Improve evening retention" |
| "Launch mobile app" | "Enable on-the-go usage" |

**Outcome Roadmap Structure:**
```
Q1: Reduce churn from 8% to 5%
├── Experiments to run
├── Metrics to track
├── Potential solutions (not committed)
└── Success criteria

Q2: Increase activation rate to 40%
├── ...
```

**Benefits:**
- Flexibility to pivot solutions
- Alignment on goals, not features
- Room for discovery
- Better stakeholder conversations

**How to Present:**
- Lead with the problem and outcome
- Show data supporting the priority
- Present options, not THE solution
- Include success metrics
