# 9 Minimum Product Frameworks

## Problem

"Just build an MVP" is lazy instruction in 2026.

## Solution: Choose the Right Framework

| Framework | Acronym | Purpose | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Minimum Viable Product | MVP | Test core assumptions | New market, unvalidated idea |
| Minimum Lovable Product | MLP | Create emotional connection | Crowded market, need differentiation |
| Minimum Marketable Product | MMP | Generate revenue | B2B, enterprise sales |
| Minimum Awesome Component | MAC | One killer feature | Feature-based differentiation |
| Riskiest Assumption Test | RAT | Validate biggest risk | High-uncertainty projects |
| Minimum Delightful Product | MDP | Exceed expectations | Premium positioning |
| Minimum Valuable Product | MVA | Deliver business value | Enterprise, ROI-focused |
| Minimum Functional Product | MFP | Technical feasibility | Complex tech, infrastructure |
| Simple, Lovable, Complete | SLC | Balance simplicity + polish | Consumer apps |

**Decision Matrix:**

| Market Condition | Recommended Framework |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Blue ocean, unvalidated | MVP or RAT |
| Red ocean, many competitors | MLP or MAC |
| Enterprise B2B | MMP or MVA |
| Consumer, emotion-driven | MLP or MDP |
| Technical uncertainty | MFP then expand |

**Key Insight 2026:** In crowded markets, MVP can be "suicide" - users already have "good enough" solutions. You need to be "awesome" or "lovable" to switch them.
