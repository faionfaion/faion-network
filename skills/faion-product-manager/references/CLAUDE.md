#### Product Frameworks (M-PRD-019 to M-PRD-020)

| ID | Topic | Description |
|----|-------|-------------|
| M-PRD-019 | 9 Minimum Product Frameworks | Beyond MVP: MLP, MMP, MAC, RAT, MDP, MVA, MFP, SLC. Decision matrix for choosing right framework based on market conditions. |
| M-PRD-020 | Micro-MVPs | Extremely small experiments (hours to days): landing page, concierge, Wizard of Oz, video demo, fake door, smoke test. |

#### AI-Native Development (M-PRD-021, M-PRD-027)

| ID | Topic | Description |
|----|-------|-------------|
| M-PRD-021 | AI-Native Product Development | AI integration layers (Research, Design, Development, Testing, Analytics, Support), AI-first architecture patterns, build vs buy decisions. |
| M-PRD-027 | Agentic AI Product Development | Autonomous AI systems: goal-oriented design, Minimum Viable Intelligence (MVI), cost structure shift, human-in-loop patterns. |

#### Discovery and Experimentation (M-PRD-022, M-PRD-026, M-PRD-030)

| ID | Topic | Description |
|----|-------|-------------|
| M-PRD-022 | Continuous Discovery | Weekly discovery habits, integration with Agile, 15-20% capacity allocation, tool recommendations (Dovetail, ProductBoard, Pendo). |
| M-PRD-026 | Experimentation at Scale | Maturity levels (Ad-hoc to Culture), modern stack (LaunchDarkly, GrowthBook, Amplitude), AI in experimentation, scale benchmarks. |
| M-PRD-030 | Continuous Discovery Habits | Teresa Torres framework: Product Trio, Opportunity Solution Tree, weekly customer touchpoints, interview best practices. |

#### Roadmaps and Strategy (M-PRD-023, M-PRD-029, M-PRD-031)

| ID | Topic | Description |
|----|-------|-------------|
| M-PRD-023 | Outcome-Based Roadmaps | Feature vs outcome roadmaps, outcome decomposition, flexibility benefits, stakeholder presentation approach. |
| M-PRD-029 | Outcome-Based Roadmaps Advanced | Stakeholder communication matrix by audience, outcome skill gap, managing roadmap pressure with confidence levels. |
| M-PRD-031 | Portfolio Strategy (70/20/10) | Three Horizons model: Core (70%), Adjacent (20%), Transformational (10%). Economic condition adjustments. |

#### Product Operations (M-PRD-024, M-PRD-025)

| ID | Topic | Description |
|----|-------|-------------|
| M-PRD-024 | Product-Led Growth (PLG) 2026 | Core principles (self-serve, time-to-value, virality, expansion), key metrics (Activation Rate, TTV, PQLs, NRR), onboarding best practices. |
| M-PRD-025 | Product Operations | Product Ops responsibilities (Process, Tools, Data, Enablement, Communication), maturity model, AI-native automation. |

#### Competitive Advantage (M-PRD-028, M-PRD-032, M-PRD-033)

| ID | Topic | Description |
|----|-------|-------------|
| M-PRD-028 | Learning Speed as Competitive Moat | Learning velocity formula, weekly rituals, AI-powered signal processing, organizational learning infrastructure. |
| M-PRD-032 | Product Explainability | Designing for AI understanding: purpose, capabilities, limitations, use cases documented for both humans and AI systems. |
| M-PRD-033 | Blurred Roles and Team Evolution | New PM skillset requirements, team structure evolution (2 PMs : 1 Engineer ratio), cross-functional expectations. |

## Key Insights

- In 2026, MVP alone is often insufficient in crowded markets; MLP or MAC may be required
- 40% of AI-mature organizations are piloting agentic systems
- Continuous discovery allocates 15-20% of team capacity to ongoing research
- Product Ops has reached 96% adoption in organizations
- Learning speed is the primary competitive moat when AI enables rapid product cloning
