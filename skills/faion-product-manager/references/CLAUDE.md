## Key Insights

- In 2026, MVP alone is often insufficient in crowded markets; MLP or MAC may be required
- 40% of AI-mature organizations are piloting agentic systems
- Continuous discovery allocates 15-20% of team capacity to ongoing research
- Product Ops has reached 96% adoption in organizations
- Learning speed is the primary competitive moat when AI enables rapid product cloning
