## M-PRD-030: Continuous Discovery Habits

### Problem

Discovery is sporadic project activity, not ongoing practice.

### Solution: Teresa Torres' Continuous Discovery Framework

**Core Concepts:**

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Product Trio | PM + Design Lead + Tech Lead working together from start |
| Opportunity Solution Tree | Visual mapping from outcome to solutions |
| Weekly Customer Touchpoints | Keystone habit of continuous discovery |

**Opportunity Solution Tree Structure:**
```
Desired Outcome (measurable)
    - Opportunity 1 (customer need/pain)
        - Solution A
        - Solution B
        - Assumption Tests

    - Opportunity 2 (customer need/pain)
        - Solution C
        - Assumption Tests
```

**Weekly Discovery Cadence:**

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Mon | Review customer feedback queue |
| Tue | Customer interview (30 min) |
| Wed | Analyze interview + behavioral data |
| Thu | Team sync: share insights |
| Fri | Plan next week's discovery |

**Interview Best Practices:**
- Talk to customers weekly (keystone habit)
- Focus on past behavior, not future predictions
- Ask about specific recent instances
- Understand the "why" behind actions
- Map insights to opportunity tree

**Discovery-Delivery Balance:**
```
Team Capacity Allocation:
- Discovery: 15-20%
- Tech Debt: 10-15%
- Delivery: 65-75%
```

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Discovery as one-time project kickoff
- PM does all discovery alone
- Interviews only when building new features
- No structured way to share insights

**Key Insight 2026:** Continuous discovery is the mindset of developing a cadence of customer conversations and getting regular feedback. Teams at Spotify, Tesco, and CarMax use this framework successfully.
