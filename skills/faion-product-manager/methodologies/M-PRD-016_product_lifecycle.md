# M-PRD-016: Product Lifecycle Management

## Problem

Products are managed the same way regardless of maturity stage. Issues:
- Growth tactics applied to declining products
- Maturity investments in early products
- No exit strategy for end-of-life
- Resource misallocation

**The root cause:** No recognition that different lifecycle stages require different strategies.
