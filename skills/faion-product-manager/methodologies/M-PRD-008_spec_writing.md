# M-PRD-008: Product Specification Writing

## Problem

Product specs are either too vague or too prescriptive. Common issues:
- "Just make it work" (no guidance)
- 50-page documents nobody reads
- Mixing what and how
- No clear acceptance criteria

**The root cause:** No template that balances completeness with conciseness.

---

## Framework

### What is a Product Spec?

A product specification (PRD) defines WHAT to build and WHY, leaving HOW to the design/engineering process. It answers: "What problem are we solving and what does success look like?"

### Spec Components

| Section | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Overview | Context and summary | 1 paragraph |
| Problem | What we're solving | 1-2 paragraphs |
| Goals | Success metrics | 3-5 bullets |
| User Stories | Who and what | 3-10 stories |
| Requirements | What's needed | Detailed list |
| Non-Requirements | What's excluded | Explicit list |
| Open Questions | Unresolved issues | As needed |

### Spec Writing Process

#### Step 1: Understand the Context

**Before writing, answer:**
- Why are we building this?
- Who requested it?
- What happens if we don't build it?
- How does this fit the product strategy?

#### Step 2: Define the Problem

**Write clearly:**
- Who has this problem?
- What is the problem specifically?
- How do they solve it today?
- What's the impact?

#### Step 3: Set Goals and Non-Goals

**Goals (3-5):**
- What will success look like?
- How will we measure it?
- What outcomes matter?

**Non-Goals:**
- What are we NOT trying to do?
- What's explicitly out of scope?

#### Step 4: Write User Stories

**Template:**
```
As a [user type]
I want to [action]
So that [benefit]
```

**Tips:**
- Focus on user value
- Be specific about the user
- Include the "so that" (motivation)

#### Step 5: Detail Requirements

**Functional Requirements (FR):**
```
FR-1: The system shall [do X]
FR-2: The system shall [do Y]
```

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Performance
- Security
- Scalability
- Accessibility

#### Step 6: Define Acceptance Criteria

**For each major feature:**
```
Given [context]
When [action]
Then [expected result]
```

#### Step 7: Call Out Open Questions

List unresolved issues for discussion:
- Technical unknowns
- Business decisions pending
- User research gaps

## Examples

### Example 1: Search Feature Spec

```markdown
# Product Search Specification

## Overview
Enable users to search products by keyword to find what they need quickly.

## Problem
Users browse through 500+ products manually. Average time to find: 3 minutes.
Support tickets: 20% are "can't find product."

## Goals
- Reduce time to find product from 3 min to 30 sec
- Reduce support tickets about finding products by 80%

## Non-Goals
- Advanced filters (separate feature)
- AI-powered recommendations
- Voice search

## User Stories
US-1: As a customer, I want to search by product name so I can find it quickly.
US-2: As a customer, I want to see search suggestions so I spell correctly.

## Requirements
- FR-1: Search bar visible on all pages (Must)
- FR-2: Results appear as user types (Must)
- FR-3: Show top 10 results with images (Should)
- FR-4: "No results" shows similar products (Could)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given I'm on any page, I see a search bar
- When I type "chair", I see products with "chair" in title
- When I search with typo "chiar", I see "Did you mean: chair"
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Mixing what and how | Spec = what; Design = how |
| No acceptance criteria | Every feature needs testable criteria |
| Missing non-goals | Explicitly state what's excluded |
| Too long | 1-3 pages for most features |
| No metrics | Define measurable success |
| Skipping open questions | Document unknowns |
| Writing alone | Collaborate with stakeholders |
