## M-PRD-033: Blurred Roles and Team Evolution

### Problem

Traditional handoff-based team structures slow down AI-era development.

### Solution: Overlapping Venn Diagram Teams

**The New PM Skillset:**

| Traditional | 2026 Required |
|-------------|---------------|
| Write specs | Speak design fluently |
| Own roadmap | Understand data deeply |
| Manage stakeholders | Know how models work |
| Prioritize features | Have credible view on distribution |
| | Understand pricing strategy |

**Team Structure Evolution:**
```
Traditional Ratio: 1 PM : 4-8 Engineers
AI-Era Ratio: 2 PMs : 1 Engineer (Andrew Ng observation)
```

**Cross-Functional Expectations:**

| Role | Now Expected To |
|------|-----------------|
| PM | Speak design, understand data, know AI basics |
| Designer | Understand constraints, track metrics |
| Engineer | Join discovery, talk to customers |
| Data | Participate in product decisions |

**Key Insight 2026:** Modern product teams feel more like overlapping Venn diagrams than relay-race handoffs. This overlap is not a bug - it's the operating model.
