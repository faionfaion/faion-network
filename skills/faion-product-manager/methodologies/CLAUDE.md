## Methodology Structure

Each file follows a consistent format:

```
Metadata (id, name, domain, skill, category)
Problem (what issue it solves)
Framework (step-by-step process)
Templates (ready-to-use documents)
Examples (real-world applications)
Common Mistakes (what to avoid)
Related Methodologies (connections)
Agent (how to invoke related agent)
```

## Usage

Reference methodologies by file name (e.g., `feature-prioritization-rice.md`) when applying frameworks. Each methodology can be used standalone or combined with related methodologies for comprehensive product planning.
