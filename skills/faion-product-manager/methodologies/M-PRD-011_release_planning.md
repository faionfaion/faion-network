## Problem

Releases are chaotic, missed, or anticlimactic. Common issues:
- No clear release strategy
- Features ready but not shipped
- Broken releases to customers
- No communication plan

**The root cause:** No structured approach to bundling, planning, and executing releases.

---

## Framework

### What is Release Planning?

Release planning is deciding what goes into each release, when it ships, and how it's communicated. It answers: "What are we shipping, when, and to whom?"

### Release Types

| Type | Frequency | Scope | Risk |
|------|-----------|-------|------|
| Major | Quarterly | Large features, breaking changes | High |
| Minor | Monthly | New features, improvements | Medium |
| Patch | Weekly/As needed | Bug fixes, security | Low |
| Hotfix | Immediate | Critical fixes | Very Low |

### Release Planning Process

#### Step 1: Define Release Goals

**Questions:**
- What user outcomes does this release enable?
- What business metrics should it move?
- What's the theme or story?

**Template:**
```
Release [Version]
Goal: [Primary outcome]
Success Metric: [How we'll measure]
Theme: [Optional narrative]
```

#### Step 2: Select Release Contents

**Include:**
- Completed features meeting definition of done
- Related bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Configuration changes

**Exclude:**
- Half-finished features
- Unrelated bug fixes (next release)
- "Just one more thing" scope creep

#### Step 3: Assess Release Readiness

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All features code complete
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Migrations tested
- [ ] Rollback plan exists
- [ ] Support team briefed
- [ ] Release notes written

#### Step 4: Plan Communication

**Stakeholders to notify:**
- Internal: Team, support, sales
- External: Customers, partners, public

**Communication assets:**
- Release notes
- Blog post / changelog
- Email to customers
- Social media
- In-app notifications

#### Step 5: Execute Release

**Release process:**
1. Final testing in staging
2. Announce maintenance window (if needed)
3. Deploy to production
4. Verify deployment
5. Monitor metrics
6. Announce release

#### Step 6: Post-Release

- Monitor for issues
- Gather feedback
- Retrospective
- Update roadmap
