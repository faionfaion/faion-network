## Product-Led Growth (PLG)

### Problem

Traditional sales-led growth is expensive and doesn't scale for modern SaaS.

### Solution: Product as Growth Engine

**PLG Core Principles:**

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Self-serve onboarding | Users activate without sales intervention |
| Time-to-value optimization | "Aha moment" within minutes, not days |
| Product virality | Built-in sharing and collaboration features |
| Expansion revenue | Upsell through usage, not sales calls |

**Key PLG Metrics 2026:**

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Activation Rate | % users completing key value actions | >40% |
| Time-to-Value (TTV) | Minutes to "aha moment" | <5 min |
| Product Qualified Leads (PQLs) | Users showing buying signals | Track weekly |
| Expansion Revenue Rate | Revenue from self-serve upgrades | >30% of total |
| Net Revenue Retention (NRR) | Revenue retained + expansion | >120% |

**PLG Onboarding Best Practices:**
```
1. SSO/social login (reduce step-one drop-off)
2. Interactive product tours, not documentation
3. Progressive feature disclosure (not feature dump)
4. Contextual tooltips at moment of relevance
5. Personalized onboarding paths by user segment
```

**PLG Evolution 2026:**
- One-size-fits-all freemium is declining
- Tailored free tiers based on user personas
- AI-driven personalization in onboarding
- Hybrid PLG + sales-assist for enterprise

**Key Insight:** PLG companies achieve higher revenue per employee. Ahrefs reached $40M ARR with just 40 employees using pure PLG.
