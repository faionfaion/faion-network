## Micro-MVPs

### Problem

Traditional MVPs still take weeks/months to build.

### Solution: Micro-MVPs

**Definition:** Extremely small, high-signal experiments designed to validate one key assumption at a time.

**Examples:**
| Type | Effort | Validates |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Landing page | 1 day | Demand, messaging |
| Concierge | 1 week | Workflow, value |
| Wizard of Oz | Days | UX, willingness to pay |
| Video demo | Hours | Interest, virality |
| Fake door | Hours | Feature demand |
| Smoke test | Days | Price sensitivity |

**Micro-MVP Process:**
```
1. Identify riskiest assumption
2. Design smallest experiment to test it
3. Define success metrics before starting
4. Run experiment (hours-days)
5. Analyze results
6. Decide: pivot, persevere, or next assumption
```

**Example: Dropbox**
```
Assumption: People want easy file sync
Micro-MVP: 3-minute video explaining concept
Result: Waitlist jumped from 5K to 75K overnight
Cost: Video production time only
```
