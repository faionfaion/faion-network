# User Research at Scale

## Problem

Traditional research doesn't scale with product velocity.

## Solution: AI-Augmented Research Operations

**Scaling Research:**
| Team Size | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Small | Intuitive tools, built-in automation, AI analysis |
| Large | Scalability, collaboration, adaptable workflows |

**AI Capabilities for Scale:**
- Automate usability testing identification
- Test with thousands of users simultaneously
- Real-time sentiment tagging
- Cross-demographic analysis
- Pattern recognition at scale

**Platform Capabilities:**
| Platform | Key Features |
|----------|--------------|
| Userlytics | Global panel (2M+), AI analytics |
| Maze | Bias detection, dynamic follow-ups |
| UserTesting | Scale unmoderated testing |
| dscout | Mobile ethnography at scale |

**AI as Co-Pilot Model:**
```
Human Researcher + AI Tools
        |
Human: Strategy, interpretation, empathy
AI: Data processing, pattern detection, speed
        |
Output: More research, faster, with human quality
```

**Research Market Growth:**
- UX Research Software Market: 9.1% CAGR (2025-2035)
- Heavy investment in AI-powered insights, automation, real-time reporting

**2026 Multi-Agent Systems:**
