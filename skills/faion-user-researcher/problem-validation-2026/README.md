## Problem Validation 2026

### Problem

Building products nobody needs.

### Solution: Evidence-Based Validation

**Validation Hierarchy:**
```
Strongest evidence:
    - 1. Users paid for solution (actual behavior)
    - 2. Users signed up/committed (commitment)
    - 3. Users engaged deeply with prototype (behavior)
    - 4. Users expressed strong interest (stated preference)
    - 5. Users said they have the problem (weakest)
```

**Mom Test Questions (2025 Updates):**
> Ask about their life, not your idea.

| Instead of | Ask |
|------------|-----|
| "Would you use this?" | "How do you currently solve X?" |
| "Is this a problem for you?" | "Tell me about the last time you dealt with X" |
| "Would you pay $X?" | "What have you tried? What did it cost?" |
| "Do you think this is a good idea?" | "When was the last time you faced this problem?" |

**Interview Opening Framework (2025):**
```
Vision -> Framing -> Weakness -> Pedestal -> Ask
1. State the problem you want to solve
2. Explain you have nothing to sell (just learning)
3. Humbly ask for their experience
4. Request some time
```

**Commitment Signals to Look For:**
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Time | Follow-up meeting, using prototype |
| Reputation | Introducing to boss/team |
| Money | Letter of intent, pre-order |

**Red Flags:**
- Compliments ("Great idea!")
- Hypotheticals ("I would definitely...")
- Generic statements ("Everyone needs this")
- Fishing for approval responses

**Key 2025 Principle:** Validating your startup idea isn't a one-time event - it's an ongoing process. The goal isn't to prove your idea is right; it's to find out if it's wrong as quickly and cheaply as possible.
