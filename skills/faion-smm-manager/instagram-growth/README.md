## Problem

Growing on Instagram requires consistent effort and strategic planning. Most accounts fail because they lack a systematic approach to content, engagement, and conversion.

---

## Framework

### Step 1: Content Calendar

**Weekly posting schedule:**

| Day | Content | Format |
|-----|---------|--------|
| **Monday** | Educational tip | Reel |
| **Tuesday** | Behind the scenes | Story + Reel |
| **Wednesday** | Trend/entertainment | Reel |
| **Thursday** | Value/tutorial | Reel + Carousel |
| **Friday** | Engagement/fun | Reel + Story |
| **Saturday** | User content/testimonial | Reel |
| **Sunday** | Inspirational/story | Reel |

**Posting frequency:**

| Content Type | Minimum | Optimal |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Reels** | 5/week | 14/week (2/day) |
| **Stories** | Daily | 3-7/day |
| **Feed posts** | 2/week | 3-4/week |
| **Carousels** | 1/week | 2-3/week |

### Step 2: Engagement Strategy

**Daily engagement routine (30-60 min):**

| Activity | Duration | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Reply to comments | 10 min | Build relationships |
| Reply to DMs | 10 min | Conversions |
| Comment on similar accounts | 15 min | Visibility |
| Engage with hashtag posts | 10 min | Discovery |
| Reply to Stories | 10 min | Network building |

**Comment strategy:**
- Be first to comment on big accounts
- Add value, not just "Nice post!"
- Ask questions
- Share relevant experience
- Use this visibility to get followers

### Step 3: Convert to Customers

**Instagram sales funnel:**

```
Reels (Discovery) → Profile Visit → Follow
                                      ↓
                               Stories (Trust)
                                      ↓
                               DM Conversation
                                      ↓
                               Link/Purchase
```

**DM automation strategy:**
- Set up auto-reply for keywords
- Create saved quick replies
- Use DM trigger in captions ("DM 'GUIDE'")
- Qualify leads in DM before sending link

**Conversion tactics:**
- Link in bio (update regularly)
- Story links (swipe up)
- DM triggers in posts
- Pinned posts with offers
- Product tags (if selling)
