## Problem

You have customers but no community. Without a community, you lose valuable feedback loops, rely entirely on paid acquisition, and watch competitors build loyal tribes while your users remain transactional.

Communities create moats. They generate content, provide support, and become your best sales force. But most founders either skip community or build ghost towns nobody visits.

---

## Framework

Community building follows a proven path:

```
SEED      -> Invite first 50 engaged users
NURTURE   -> Create rituals and valuable content
SCALE     -> Enable member-to-member connections
MONETIZE  -> Community becomes product feature
```

### Step 1: Choose Your Platform

| Platform | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| **Discord** | Tech, gaming, crypto | Real-time, rich features | Noisy, hard to search |
| **Slack** | B2B, professional | Familiar, searchable | Expensive at scale |
| **Circle** | Courses, memberships | Structured, monetizable | Less sticky |
| **Reddit** | Public communities | SEO, organic growth | Less control |
| **X/Twitter** | Public building | Distribution, reach | No ownership |

**Rule:** Pick ONE platform. Multi-platform splits attention.

### Step 2: Define Community Value

**The 3 pillars of valuable communities:**

1. **Access** - To you, experts, or exclusive info
2. **Connection** - To peers with similar goals
3. **Content** - Educational, entertaining, or actionable

**Example value propositions:**
- "Get direct access to founders who've scaled to $10M ARR"
- "Connect with 500+ solopreneurs building in public"
- "Weekly teardowns of successful product launches"

### Step 3: Seed Your First Members

**Quantity:** Start with 50-100 hand-picked members.

**Quality filters:**
- Already engaged (email subscribers, early users)
- Have relevant expertise to share
- Will actually participate

**Invitation script:**
```
Hey [Name],

I'm building a small community of [description].

I loved your [recent post/project/comment] about [topic].

Would you like early access? We're keeping it small
(~50 people) to maintain quality conversations.

```

### Step 4: Create Rituals

**Daily rituals:**
- Morning standup thread (what are you working on?)
- Win/loss sharing

**Weekly rituals:**
- Office hours with you
- Member spotlight
- Weekly roundup newsletter

**Monthly rituals:**
- Guest AMAs
- Challenge/hackathon
- Retrospective thread

### Step 5: Enable Member Connections

**Connection accelerators:**

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Intro threads** | New members introduce themselves |
| **Pairing** | Match members with similar goals |
| **Breakout groups** | Smaller cohorts (5-10 people) |
| **Collaboration board** | Members seek/offer help |
| **1:1 matching** | Automated or curated intros |

### Step 6: Measure Community Health

**Key metrics:**

| Metric | Good | Great | Formula |
|--------|------|-------|---------|
| **DAU/MAU** | 20% | 40%+ | Daily active / Monthly active |
| **Post rate** | 10% | 25%+ | Members who posted this month |
| **Response time** | <4h | <1h | Average time to first reply |
| **Retention** | 70% | 85%+ | Members active after 30 days |
| **NPS** | 30 | 50+ | Promoters - Detractors |
