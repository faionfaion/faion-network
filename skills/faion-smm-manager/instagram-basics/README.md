## Problem

Instagram has 2B+ monthly active users and remains the most important platform for brand building and visual storytelling. But organic reach has declined dramatically. Most businesses post inconsistently, ignore Reels, and wonder why they're not growing.

The platform now prioritizes video content (Reels) and rewards accounts that keep users on the platform. Most businesses fail because they treat Instagram like a photo gallery instead of an entertainment platform.

---

## Framework

Instagram growth in 2024+ requires a multi-format approach:

```
REELS      -> Discovery and reach (80% of effort)
STORIES    -> Engagement and relationships (15%)
FEED       -> Credibility and portfolio (5%)
DMs        -> Conversion and sales
```

### Step 1: Profile Optimization

**Profile elements:**

| Element | Best Practice | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Username** | Searchable, memorable | @yourproduct or @founder.name |
| **Display name** | Include keyword | "Mike | SaaS Growth" |
| **Bio line 1** | What you do + for whom | "Helping devs launch products" |
| **Bio line 2** | Proof/credibility | "Built 3 products to $10K MRR" |
| **Bio line 3** | CTA | "DM 'START' for free guide" |
| **Link** | One clear destination | Landing page or link tree |

**Profile picture:**
- Face clearly visible
- Consistent with other platforms
- Bright, professional
- Works at small size

**Highlights:**
- About/Intro
- Products/Services
- Testimonials
- FAQ
- Free Resources

### Step 2: Reels Strategy (Priority #1)

**Why Reels dominate:**
- 2x more reach than photos
- Algorithm pushes to non-followers
- TikTok-like discovery potential
- Instagram's priority format

**Reels content pillars:**

| Pillar | Type | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Educational** | Quick tips, tutorials | "3 Figma shortcuts" |
| **Entertaining** | Trends, humor, relatable | Industry memes, skits |
| **Inspirational** | Motivational, story-driven | Founder journey |
| **Behind scenes** | Process, day-in-life | Building product live |
| **Results** | Before/after, case studies | Client transformations |

**Reels best practices:**

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Length** | 7-15 sec for virality, 30-60 for depth |
| **Hook** | First 1-2 seconds critical |
| **Text on screen** | Always (80% watch muted) |
| **Trending audio** | Use when relevant |
| **Original audio** | Good for tutorials |
| **Hashtags** | 3-5 relevant ones |
| **Caption** | Add context, CTA |

### Step 3: Stories Strategy

**Stories drive engagement:**
- Only seen by followers (mostly)
- Build relationships
- Drive DMs and conversions
- Test content ideas

**Story types:**

| Type | Purpose | Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Day in life** | Relatability | 2-3/week |
| **Polls/Questions** | Engagement | Daily |
| **Tips/Value** | Authority | 2-3/week |
| **Product tease** | Sales | 1-2/week |
| **Reposts** | Community | As relevant |
| **Behind scenes** | Authenticity | Daily |

**Story features to use:**
- Polls: "Which do you prefer A or B?"
- Questions: "What's your biggest challenge with X?"
- Quizzes: Test knowledge
- Sliders: Rate something
- Countdown: Build anticipation
- Links: Drive traffic (swipe up)

### Step 4: Hashtag Strategy

**Hashtag tiers:**

| Tier | Post Volume | Usage |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Small** | <50K posts | 2-3 hashtags |
| **Medium** | 50K-500K posts | 2-3 hashtags |
| **Large** | 500K-2M posts | 1-2 hashtags |
| **Huge** | >2M posts | 0-1 hashtags |

**Hashtag formula for posts:**
- 3-5 hashtags total (not 30)
- Mix of sizes
- Relevant to content
- Place in caption or first comment

**Finding hashtags:**
1. Search what competitors use
2. Check what industry leaders use
3. Use Instagram search suggestions
4. Test and track performance
