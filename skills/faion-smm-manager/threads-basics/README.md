## Problem

Meta's Threads launched as a Twitter/X alternative and crossed 100M+ users in days. The platform is still maturing, but early adopters have a massive opportunity. Algorithm favors engagement and conversation. Less competition than Twitter.

Most people fail because they either ignore Threads entirely or simply cross-post from Twitter without adapting. The platform has different dynamics and rewards authentic, conversational content.

---

## Framework

Threads growth leverages your Instagram following while building a new audience:

```
INSTAGRAM SYNC  -> Import followers automatically
CONVERSATION    -> Reply, engage, discuss
CONSISTENCY     -> Post multiple times daily
PERSONALITY     -> Be authentic and conversational
TRENDS          -> Jump on platform-specific trends
```

---

## Step 1: Account Setup

**Profile optimization:**

| Element | Best Practice | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Username** | Same as Instagram | Auto-synced |
| **Display name** | Searchable, with keyword | Can differ from IG |
| **Bio** | Short, punchy, clear | 160 characters max |
| **Link** | One URL | Update based on goals |
| **Profile photo** | Same as Instagram | Synced automatically |

**Bio formula:**
```
[What you do] → [Who you help] → [CTA or personality]

Examples:
- Building SaaS tools → Helping devs ship faster → Let's chat
- Founder of @product → Sharing the journey → DM me anything
- Marketing for startups → 0 → 1 growth tips → Follow for daily insights
```

**Instagram integration:**
- Profile pulls from Instagram
- Option to auto-share to Instagram
- Followers can easily switch
- Cross-promotion built-in

## Step 2: Content Strategy

**What works on Threads:**

| Content Type | Performance | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Hot takes** | High | Unpopular opinions about your industry |
| **Questions** | Very High | "What's the one tool you can't live without?" |
| **Personal stories** | High | Quick anecdotes, lessons learned |
| **Quick tips** | Medium-High | Actionable advice in 1-2 sentences |
| **Engagement bait** | Very High | "Only respond with one word..." |
| **Threads (multiple posts)** | High | Multi-part stories or tips |

**Content types to avoid:**
- Overly promotional posts
- Long-form content (save for Twitter/blogs)
- Cross-posts that don't fit platform
- Content without engagement hooks

**Content pillars:**

| Pillar | Description | Frequency |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Opinions** | Takes on industry topics | 2-3/day |
| **Value** | Tips, insights, learnings | 1-2/day |
| **Questions** | Engagement drivers | 1/day |
| **Personal** | Behind the scenes, stories | 1/day |
| **Curated** | Interesting finds, quotes | 1/day |

---

## Step 3: Posting Strategy

**Optimal cadence:**

| Metric | Minimum | Optimal |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Posts/day** | 3 | 7-10 |
| **Replies/day** | 20 | 50+ |
| **Engagement time** | 15 min | 45+ min |

**Best times to post:**
- Morning: 8-10 AM (early engagement)
- Lunch: 12-2 PM (break scrolling)
- Evening: 6-9 PM (prime time)
- Test for YOUR audience

**Posting tips:**
- No scheduling yet (use manual posting)
- Spread posts throughout day
- Reply within first hour for algorithm boost
- Quote other posts to add commentary
