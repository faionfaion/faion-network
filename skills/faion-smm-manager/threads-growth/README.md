| **Category** | Marketing |
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Agent** | faion-social-agent |

## Step 1: Engagement Strategy

**Reply strategy (key to growth):**

1. Turn on notifications for large accounts
2. Be first to reply with value
3. Add insight, not just agreement
4. Ask follow-up questions
5. Be genuinely helpful

**Reply formula:**
```
[Agree/Disagree] + [Add your perspective] + [Question or invitation]

Bad: "Great point!"
Good: "This is so true. I found the same thing when building [X]. What made you realize this?"
```

**Thread replies (multi-post responses):**
- Start a conversation on your own post
- Reply to yourself to extend thoughts
- Creates more engagement surface area
- Algorithm sees it as active conversation

---

## Step 2: Building Conversations

**Conversation starters:**

| Type | Template | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **This or That** | "[A] or [B]?" | "Notion or Obsidian?" |
| **Hot take** | "Unpopular opinion: [take]" | "Unpopular opinion: MVPs are overrated" |
| **Fill in blank** | "The best [X] is ___" | "The best VSCode extension is ___" |
| **Experience** | "Raise your hand if you've ever [X]" | "Raise your hand if you've ever shipped on Friday" |
| **Prediction** | "In 2025, [prediction]" | "In 2025, AI will replace [X]" |

**Building genuine connections:**
- Reply thoughtfully to others
- Remember previous conversations
- Share others' good content
- Be generous with credit
- Collaborate publicly

---

## Step 3: Cross-Platform Strategy

**Threads + Instagram synergy:**

```
Instagram Reels → Drive discovery
        ↓
    Profile visit
        ↓
    Thread follow (linked in bio)
        ↓
    Threads engagement → Deeper connection
        ↓
    Back to Instagram → Full-circle
```

**Cross-posting guidelines:**

| From | To Threads | Adaptation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Twitter/X | Yes with edits | Soften tone, more conversational |
| Instagram captions | Sometimes | Shorten, add question |
| LinkedIn | Rarely | Too formal usually |
| Blog posts | Extract quotes | One key insight per post |

**What NOT to cross-post:**
- Highly promotional content
- Platform-specific content (TikTok trends)
- Long threads (break into multiple posts)
- Content with platform-specific features

---

## Step 4: Convert to Business

**Threads funnel:**

```
Posts → Engagement → Profile visit → Link click
                          ↓
                    Instagram follow → Deeper relationship
```

**Conversion tactics:**
- Link in bio (one clear CTA)
- Mention your product naturally in stories
- Share genuine wins/updates
- Reply to relevant questions with your solution
- Don't be pushy (platform is anti-promotional)

**Lead generation:**
- DM conversations (manual, no automation yet)
- Profile link to landing page
- Mention newsletter/resource naturally
- Cross-promote from Instagram Stories
