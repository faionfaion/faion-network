## Problem

You post randomly on social media with no strategy. You get inconsistent results, waste time creating content nobody sees, and watch competitors build audiences while you stay stuck.

Most social media fails because people spread across too many platforms, focus on follower count instead of engagement, and give up before momentum builds.

---

## Framework

Social media strategy follows the PACE framework:

```
Platform → Audience → Content → Engagement
    ↓          ↓          ↓           ↓
 Pick 1-2   Define    Create      Build
 max        ICP       system      community
```

### Step 1: Platform Selection

**Choose based on your audience and content type:**

| Platform | Best For | Content Types | Audience |
|----------|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Twitter/X** | Thought leadership | Text, threads | Tech, creators |
| **LinkedIn** | B2B, professional | Articles, carousels | Professionals |
| **Instagram** | Visual brands | Images, reels | Gen Z, millennials |
| **TikTok** | Entertainment, reach | Short video | Gen Z |
| **YouTube** | Long-form education | Video | All ages |
| **Reddit** | Community, authenticity | Text, discussion | Tech, niche |

**Platform fit matrix:**

```markdown
## Platform Score Card

Rate 1-5 for each:

| Criteria | Twitter | LinkedIn | Instagram |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Audience present | | | |
| Content I enjoy creating | | | |
| Competitors active | | | |
| Growth potential | | | |
| **Total** | | | |

Pick the highest scorer.
```

**Rule:** Master ONE platform before adding another.

### Step 2: Content Pillars

**Define 3-5 content themes:**

```markdown
## Content Pillars for [Brand]

1. **[Pillar 1]** (40%) - [Description]
2. **[Pillar 2]** (30%) - [Description]
3. **[Pillar 3]** (20%) - [Description]
4. **Behind the scenes** (10%) - Personal, human

Example for SaaS founder:
1. Product updates (40%)
2. Industry insights (30%)
3. Building in public (20%)
4. Personal wins/fails (10%)
```

### Step 3: Content Formats

**Twitter/X content types:**

| Format | Purpose | Structure |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Tweet** | Insight | 1 idea, <280 chars |
| **Thread** | Education | Hook + 5-10 tweets |
| **Quote tweet** | Engagement | Add value to others |
| **Poll** | Engagement | Opinion questions |

**LinkedIn content types:**

| Format | Purpose | Structure |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Text post** | Thought leadership | Hook, story, lesson |
| **Carousel** | Education | 5-10 slides |
| **Article** | Deep dive | Long-form |
| **Video** | Personality | <3 minutes |

**Instagram content types:**

| Format | Purpose | Structure |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Feed post** | Value | Single image + caption |
| **Carousel** | Education | 5-10 slides |
| **Reels** | Reach | 15-60 seconds |
| **Stories** | Behind scenes | Casual, daily |

### Step 4: Content Calendar

**Posting frequency by platform:**

| Platform | Minimum | Optimal |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Twitter/X | 1/day | 3-5/day |
| LinkedIn | 3/week | 1/day |
| Instagram | 3/week | 1/day |
| TikTok | 1/day | 3/day |
| YouTube | 1/week | 2/week |

**Weekly content template:**

```markdown

### Tuesday
- [ ] Twitter: 3 tweets
- [ ] Instagram: Reel

- [ ] LinkedIn: Text post

### Thursday
- [ ] Twitter: Poll + 2 tweets
- [ ] Instagram: Carousel

### Friday
- [ ] Twitter: Thread (recap)
- [ ] LinkedIn: Personal story
```

### Step 5: Engagement Strategy

**The 5-5-5 method (daily):**

1. Spend 5 minutes engaging with accounts you follow
2. Spend 5 minutes replying to comments on your posts
3. Spend 5 minutes finding new accounts to engage with

**Engagement tactics:**

- Reply to comments within 1 hour
- Ask questions at end of posts
