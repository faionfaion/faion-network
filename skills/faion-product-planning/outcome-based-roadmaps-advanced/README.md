## Outcome-Based Roadmaps Advanced

### Problem

Stakeholders still demand feature timelines despite outcome focus.

### Solution: Advanced Outcome Roadmap Practices

**Stakeholder Communication Matrix:**

| Audience | Roadmap Style | Include Dates? |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| External (customers) | Theme-based | No (use "H1 2026") |
| Board/Executives | Outcome metrics | Quarterly targets |
| Engineering | Outcome + options | Sprint-level |
| Sales | Problem-solution | When confident |

**Outcome Decomposition:**
```
Business Goal: Increase revenue 20%
    - Product Outcome: Reduce churn from 8% to 5%
        - Leading Indicator: NPS improvement
        - Experiments: Onboarding, re-engagement
        - Success Criteria: Defined upfront

    - Product Outcome: Increase activation to 40%
        - Leading Indicator: TTV reduction
        - Experiments: Guided tours, personalization
        - Success Criteria: Statistical significance
```

**The Outcome Skill Gap:**
- Breaking high-level goals to product outcomes is THE most critical PM skill for 2026
- Role evolution: "Owner of roadmap" -> "Architect of impact"
- Revenue and profitability are top success metrics for product teams

**Managing Roadmap Pressure:**
- Use confidence levels instead of commitments
- Present options, not THE solution
- Lead with data supporting priority
- Show the "why" before the "what"

**Tools for Outcome Roadmaps:**

| Tool | Strength |

| Airfocus | Intuitive outcome-based builder |
