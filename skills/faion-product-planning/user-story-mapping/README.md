## Problem

Flat backlogs lose context of user workflows. Common issues:
- Stories prioritized without seeing full picture
- Missing critical steps in user journeys
- No visualization of release scope
- Disconnect between stories and user goals

**The root cause:** Linear lists can't represent the multi-dimensional nature of user experience.

## Framework

### What is User Story Mapping?

User story mapping is a technique that arranges user stories into a visual model showing user activities horizontally and story priority vertically. It answers: "How does our backlog connect to the user's journey?"

### Story Map Structure

```
                    BACKBONE (User Activities)
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
    [Activity 1]     [Activity 2]     [Activity 3]
    ─────────────    ─────────────    ─────────────

    WALKING SKELETON (Minimum viable flow)
    ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
    │  Task 1.1   │  │  Task 2.1   │  │  Task 3.1   │
    └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘

    RELEASE 1 ═══════════════════════════════════════
    ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
    │  Task 1.2   │  │  Task 2.2   │  │  Task 3.2   │
    └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  │  Task 3.3   │
                                      └─────────────┘

    RELEASE 2 ═══════════════════════════════════════
    │  Task 1.3   │  │  Task 2.3   │  │  Task 3.4   │
    │  Task 1.4   │  │  Task 2.4   │  │  Task 3.5   │
```

### Story Map Components

#### 1. Backbone (Top Row)

**What:** High-level user activities
**Example:** Sign Up → Create Project → Invite Team → Track Progress

**Rules:**
- Left to right = user's journey
- Verb phrases ("Create Project" not "Project")
- 5-10 activities typically

#### 2. User Tasks (Under Each Activity)

**What:** Specific things user does within each activity
**Example under "Create Project":** Name project, Set deadline, Add description

**Rules:**
- Vertical = priority (higher = more important)
- Each task is testable
- Maps to user stories

#### 3. Walking Skeleton

**What:** Minimum tasks to complete the entire journey end-to-end
**Purpose:** Earliest version that proves the concept

**Rules:**
- One task per activity minimum
- Complete journey (not just start)
- Foundation for releases

#### 4. Release Slices

**What:** Horizontal lines grouping tasks for each release
**Purpose:** Define what's in each version

**Rules:**
- Each slice is shippable value
- Earlier slices = higher priority
- Validates scope decisions

### Story Mapping Process

#### Step 1: Frame the Journey

**Define:**
- Who is the user?
- What's their big goal?
- Where does the journey start/end?

#### Step 2: Build the Backbone

**Workshop activity:**
1. Write activities on cards
2. Arrange left to right in order
3. Verify: "Does this feel like the user's journey?"

#### Step 3: Add Tasks

**For each activity:**
1. What does the user DO here?
2. Write each task on a card
3. Place under activity column
4. Arrange vertically by importance

#### Step 4: Identify the Walking Skeleton

**Draw a line separating:**
- Absolute minimum to work end-to-end
- Everything else

#### Step 5: Slice Releases

**For each release:**
1. What value does this deliver?
2. Draw horizontal line
3. Name the release goal
4. Validate: "Is this shippable?"

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Starting with tasks | Build backbone first |
| Only happy path | Include error handling tasks |
| Too detailed backbone | Keep to 5-10 activities |
| No walking skeleton | Always identify minimum path |
| Releases too big | Slice smaller, deliver faster |
| Solo mapping | Involve team for shared understanding |
| Static map | Update as you learn |
