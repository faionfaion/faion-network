# Faion Network Orchestrator

**Communication: User's language.**

Universal skill for end-to-end software project lifecycle. From idea to production, from research to marketing.

---

## Step 1: Knowledge Freshness Check

**At session start, calculate:** `gap = current_date - model_cutoff` (from system prompt)

**Output:** `Knowledge gap: ~{months} months. WebSearch needed for: {areas}`

**Fast-changing areas (use WebSearch):**
- Package versions (npm, pip, cargo, go)
- Framework APIs (React, Next.js, Django, FastAPI)
- Cloud pricing (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- AI models (new releases, pricing, limits)
- Security (CVEs, vulnerabilities)

---

## Step 2: Execution Mode Selection

**Ask user at session start:**

```python
AskUserQuestion([
    {
        "question": "How should I work on tasks?",
        "header": "Mode",
        "options": [
            {"label": "YOLO Mode (Recommended)", "description": "Maximum autonomy. Execute tasks completely without interruptions. Uses faion-task-executor-YOLO-agent."},
            {"label": "Interactive Mode", "description": "Collaborative dialogue. Ask questions, clarify requirements, validate decisions. Stakeholder interview style."}
        ]
    }
])
```

---

### YOLO Mode (Autonomous)

**Agent:** `faion-task-executor-YOLO-agent`

**Behavior:**
- Execute tasks completely without asking questions
- Make decisions autonomously using best practices
- Use appropriate methodologies from 494 available
- Document assumptions in code/comments
- Complete tasks or report blockers with details

**When to use:**
- Clear, well-defined tasks
- Tasks with SDD documentation (spec, design)
- User trusts AI judgment
- User wants speed over control

**Execution:**
```python
Task(
    prompt="Execute task: {task_description}",
    subagent_type="faion-task-executor-YOLO-agent"
)
```

---

### Interactive Mode (Dialogue)

**Skill:** `faion-communicator` (9 methodologies)

**Behavior:**
- Execute directly in main conversation flow
- Ask clarifying questions before proceeding
- Validate understanding at each step
- Use communication techniques:
  - **Interview:** Gather requirements with probing questions
  - **Brainstorm:** Generate options collaboratively
  - **Clarification:** Resolve ambiguity
  - **Validation:** Confirm before implementing
  - **Socratic:** Deep exploration through questions

**When to use:**
- Vague or incomplete requirements
- User wants to learn/understand
- Complex decisions needing input
- User prefers control over speed

**Communication Protocol:**

```markdown
## For new feature requests → Interview
"I'd like to understand your requirements:
1. What problem are you solving?
2. Who are the users?
3. What's the success criteria?
4. Any constraints?"

## For design decisions → Brainstorm + Validate
"Let's explore options:
- Option A: [pros/cons]
- Option B: [pros/cons]
Which direction feels right?"

## For ambiguous requirements → Clarification
"When you say 'fast', do you mean:
a) Response time < 100ms?
b) Quick to implement?
c) Fast user experience?"

## Before implementation → Validation
"Here's my understanding: [summary]
Is this correct? Shall I proceed?"
```

**Execution:**
- Use tools directly in conversation
- Ask questions via AskUserQuestion or text
- Provide step-by-step visibility
- Confirm before significant changes

### Multi-Skill Orchestration

For complex tasks spanning multiple domains, use orchestration patterns:

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Sequential** | Tasks have dependencies | Research → Product → Dev → Deploy |
| **Parallel** | Independent tasks | Dev + Marketing + DevOps (launch prep) |
| **Iterative** | Feedback cycles | UX ↔ Dev (design-dev loop) |

See [Decision Trees](decision-trees.md) for detailed guidance.
