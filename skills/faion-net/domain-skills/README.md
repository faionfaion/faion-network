## Multi-Skill Orchestration

For complex tasks spanning multiple domains, use orchestration patterns:

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Sequential** | Tasks have dependencies | Research → Product → Dev → Deploy |
| **Parallel** | Independent tasks | Dev + Marketing + DevOps (launch prep) |
| **Iterative** | Feedback cycles | UX ↔ Dev (design-dev loop) |
