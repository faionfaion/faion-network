## Problem

TikTok has 1.5B+ monthly active users and the highest organic reach of any social platform. But most B2B founders and SaaS marketers dismiss it as "just for Gen Z dancing." Meanwhile, competitors are getting millions of views and acquiring customers at near-zero CAC.

The platform rewards creativity, authenticity, and trend awareness. Most businesses fail because they post corporate content that doesn't fit the platform's native style.

---

## Framework

TikTok growth follows a different pattern than other platforms:

```
HOOK      -> Capture attention in first 1-3 seconds
RETAIN    -> Keep viewers watching till the end
CONVERT   -> Turn viewers into followers/customers
COMPOUND  -> Let algorithm amplify your best content
```

## Account Setup for Business

### Profile Optimization

| Element | Best Practice | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Username** | Simple, memorable, searchable | @yourproduct, @foundername |
| **Display name** | Include keyword | "SaaS Tips | Mike" |
| **Bio** | Hook + what you do + CTA | "I help devs launch products | Follow for 0→1 tips" |
| **Link** | Linktree or landing page | One link only (until 1K followers) |

### Account Type

- Start as Creator account (better algorithm)
- Switch to Business for analytics (after establishing)
- Creator Fund requires 10K followers + 100K views

## Content Strategy

### TikTok Content Pillars for B2B/SaaS

| Pillar | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Educational** | Quick tips, how-tos | "3 VS Code shortcuts you need" |
| **Behind the scenes** | Build in public | "Day 47 of building my startup" |
| **Trends with twist** | Use trends for your niche | Trending sound + product demo |
| **Storytelling** | Founder journey | "How I got my first 100 users" |
| **Myth busting** | Challenge assumptions | "Why your landing page sucks" |

### Video Formats That Work

| Format | Duration | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Quick tips** | 15-30 sec | Educational content |
| **Story time** | 60-90 sec | Journey, lessons learned |
| **Tutorial** | 60-180 sec | How-to content |
| **POV/Skit** | 15-30 sec | Relatable humor |
| **Before/After** | 30-60 sec | Transformations, results |
