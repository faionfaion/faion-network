## Problem

Reddit has millions of engaged users in niche communities, but it's the hardest platform to market on. Redditors hate self-promotion with a passion. One wrong move and you're banned, downvoted, or publicly shamed.

Done right, Reddit can drive massive traffic and build genuine community. Done wrong, it destroys your reputation permanently.

---

## Framework

Reddit marketing is a long game:

```
LEARN     -> Understand subreddit rules and culture
LURK      -> Read and observe for 2-4 weeks
ENGAGE    -> Participate genuinely for 4-8 weeks
VALUE     -> Share helpful content (not promotional)
```

### Step 1: Find Your Subreddits

**Research approach:**

1. Search for keywords related to your niche
2. Look for subreddits with 10K-500K members (sweet spot)
3. Check posting rules and mod activity
4. Review top posts to understand what works

**Subreddit evaluation:**

| Factor | Check For |
|--------|-----------|
| Size | 10K-500K ideal (big enough, not too competitive) |
| Activity | Posts daily, comments active |
| Rules | Self-promotion allowed? Link rules? |
| Mods | Active, fair moderation |
| Tone | Helpful? Aggressive? Professional? |

**Create a subreddit list:**
```markdown
| Subreddit | Members | Posting Rules | Relevance |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| r/SaaS | 50K | No self-promo | High |
| r/startups | 800K | Promo in thread only | Medium |
| r/entrepreneur | 1.2M | Flair for AMAs | High |
```

### Step 2: Build Karma and History

**Before any promotion:**

| Activity | Minimum | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Account age | 30+ days | Avoid spam filters |
| Comment karma | 100+ | Credibility |
| Subreddit participation | 2+ weeks | Community member |
| Non-promotional posts | 10+ | Establish reputation |

**How to build karma:**
- Answer questions in relevant subreddits
- Share interesting articles (not your own)
- Participate in discussions
- Post in casual subreddits (r/AskReddit, etc.)

### Step 3: Provide Value First

**Content that works on Reddit:**

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Guides** | Long-form, actionable | "Complete guide to X" |
| **Breakdowns** | Analysis of something | "How [company] does X" |
| **Tools/Resources** | Lists, comparisons | "Best free tools for X" |
| **Case studies** | Real results | "How I did X (with numbers)" |
| **AMAs** | Q&A format | "I'm a [role], AMA" |

**Post template (guide format):**
```markdown
# Complete Guide to [Topic]

I've spent [time] doing [thing] and learned a lot.
Here's everything I wish I knew when starting.

## Table of Contents
1. [Section 1]
2. [Section 2]
3. [Section 3]

## Section 1
[Detailed, helpful content]

## Section 2
[More value]

## Conclusion
[Summary, no pitch]

Happy to answer any questions in comments.
```

### Step 4: Strategic Self-Promotion

**When and how to promote:**

| Approach | When to Use | Format |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Mention in comment** | When directly relevant | "I built X to solve this" |
| **Self-promotion threads** | Weekly promo threads | Follow exact format |
| **Milestone posts** | Achievement to share | "Just hit $10K MRR, AMA" |
| **Case study with product** | Natural inclusion | "How I grew to X using..." |

**The 10:1 rule:** For every self-promotional piece, have 10 value-add contributions.

**Never:**
- Create fake accounts
- Astroturf (fake enthusiasm)
- Spam across subreddits
- Delete and repost
- Argue with critics

### Step 5: Handle Feedback

**Response strategy:**

| Feedback Type | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| Positive | Thank genuinely |
| Constructive criticism | Acknowledge, learn |
| Harsh but fair | Take it seriously |
| Trolls | Ignore completely |
| Questions | Answer thoroughly |

## Examples

### Example 1: Successful Reddit Strategy

**Product:** Note-taking app for developers

**Approach:**
- 6 weeks of genuine participation in r/programming

- Only mentioned product when asked

**Results:**
- 500 signups from Reddit

### Example 2: Reddit Failure

**Product:** Project management tool

**Approach:**
