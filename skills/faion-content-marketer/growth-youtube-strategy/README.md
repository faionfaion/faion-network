## Problem

YouTube is the second largest search engine and the best platform for building trust. But video is hard. Production takes forever, you feel awkward on camera, and your videos get 47 views from bots.

The truth is: YouTube rewards consistency and value, not production quality. Many successful channels started with a webcam and screen recordings.

---

## Framework

YouTube success follows the content-discovery loop:

```
POSITION  -> Define your niche and style
CREATE    -> Produce valuable, searchable content
OPTIMIZE  -> Thumbnails, titles, descriptions
GROW      -> Build viewing habits and subscribers
MONETIZE  -> Convert viewers to customers
```

### Step 1: Find Your Niche

**The niche formula:**
```
[Your expertise] + [Specific audience] + [Content format]

Example:
SaaS marketing + indie founders + tutorials and case studies
```

**Validate your niche:**

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Demand | Are people searching for this? (YouTube search) |
| Competition | Can you differentiate from existing channels? |
| Sustainability | Can you make 100+ videos on this? |
| Monetization | Is there a product/service to sell? |

**Content pillars (pick 3-4):**
- Educational (how-to, tutorials)
- Entertainment (stories, commentary)
- Inspiration (case studies, interviews)
- Updates (news, trends)

### Step 2: Content Types

**Video formats for different goals:**

| Format | Best For | Length |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Tutorials** | Search traffic, authority | 10-20 min |
| **List videos** | Easy to produce, searchable | 8-15 min |
| **Case studies** | Trust building | 15-30 min |
| **Interviews** | Audience borrowing | 30-60 min |
| **Shorts** | Discovery, top-of-funnel | <60 sec |

**Production levels:**

| Level | What's needed | When to use |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Screen recording** | Loom, Camtasia | Tutorials, demos |
| **Talking head** | Camera, mic, basic lighting | Personal content |
| **B-roll + talking** | Video clips, transitions | Higher production |
| **Full production** | Editing, graphics, color | When established |

### Step 3: Video Structure

**Proven format:**
```
0:00 - Hook (10-30 sec)
      [Grab attention, preview value]

0:30 - Intro (15-30 sec)
      [Who you are, credibility, agenda]

1:00 - Content (bulk of video)
      [Deliver value, use chapters]

Near end - CTA (30 sec)
      [Subscribe, watch next video, product]
```

**Hook types:**
- Question hook: "Ever wondered why...?"
- Promise hook: "By the end of this video, you'll know..."
- Curiosity hook: "What I'm about to show you..."
- Contrarian hook: "Everyone does X wrong..."

### Step 4: Optimization

**Title formula:**
```
[Keyword] + [Benefit] + [Curiosity element]

Examples:
- How to Get Your First 1000 Subscribers (What Actually Works)
- SEO for Beginners: 10 Steps to Rank on Google
- I Tried [Thing] for 30 Days - Here's What Happened
```

**Thumbnail best practices:**
- Face with expression (surprise, excitement)
- 3-4 words maximum
- Contrasting colors
- Clear even at small size
- Consistent style/branding

**Description template:**
```
[First 2 lines: Hook + keywords - this shows in search]

[Paragraph about video content with keywords]

TIMESTAMPS:
0:00 - Introduction
1:23 - First topic
...

RESOURCES:
- [Link to mentioned resources]
- [Your product/newsletter]

CONNECT:
- Twitter: @handle
- Website: url

#keyword1 #keyword2 #keyword3
```

### Step 5: Publishing Strategy

**Consistency beats frequency:**

| Tier | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Minimum | 1/month | Slow growth but sustainable |
| Good | Weekly | Standard for most creators |
| Aggressive | 2-3/week | Fast growth, high effort |
| Shorts | Daily | Supplement long-form |

**Publishing checklist:**
- [ ] Title and thumbnail A/B tested (if possible)
- [ ] Description complete with timestamps
- [ ] End screen and cards added
- [ ] Community post announcing video
- [ ] Share on other platforms
