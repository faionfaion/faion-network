## Problem

Podcasts build deep trust and authority. Listeners spend 30-60 minutes with you - no other medium offers that. But starting a podcast feels overwhelming, and growth is painfully slow.

The secret is that you don't need a huge audience to benefit. Being a podcast guest can be even more effective than hosting one.

---

## Framework

Two podcast strategies:

```
HOST     -> Build your own show
GUEST    -> Appear on others' shows

Both work. Guest is faster ROI. Hosting builds long-term asset.
```

### Strategy A: Being a Podcast Guest

**Why guest first:**
- No equipment investment
- Reach existing audiences
- Test content before hosting
- Build network of hosts
- Faster results

**Finding podcasts:**

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| Listen Notes | Search by topic, filter by size |
| Podcast guests platforms | Podmatch, MatchMaker.fm |
| Competitor research | Where do similar people appear? |
| Direct outreach | Cold email podcast hosts |

**Podcast pitch template:**
```
Subject: Guest idea: [Specific topic]

Hey [Host name],

I loved your recent episode with [Guest] about [topic].

I'm [one sentence about you and credibility].

I'd love to share [specific topic] with your audience.
Key points I'd cover:
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
- [Point 3]

I've been on [other podcasts] and understand how to
bring energy and value.

[Link to previous appearance or bio page]

Would this be a fit for [Podcast Name]?

[Your name]
```

### Strategy B: Hosting a Podcast

**Launch checklist:**

| Element | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Format | Solo, interview, co-host |
| Length | 15-20 min (solo), 30-60 min (interview) |
| Frequency | Weekly (minimum), bi-weekly (sustainable) |
| Hosting | Transistor, Buzzsprout, Anchor |
| Equipment | USB mic ($50-100), quiet room |

**Minimum viable podcast:**
1. USB microphone (Audio-Technica ATR2100x)
2. Recording software (Audacity, GarageBand)
3. Hosting platform (Transistor, $19/mo)
4. Cover art (Canva)
5. Episode template

**Episode structure:**
```
0:00 - Cold open (teaser from episode)
0:30 - Intro music (short, consistent)
0:45 - Host intro and episode overview
2:00 - Main content or guest interview
25:00 - Key takeaways
27:00 - CTA and outro
```

### Guest Interview Process

**Finding great guests:**
- Authors who recently published
- Founders with interesting stories
- Experts you want to learn from
- People your audience follows

**Interview prep:**
- Research guest thoroughly (last 5 interviews)
- Prepare 10 questions (you'll use 5-7)
- Share general topics (not exact questions)
- Test tech 15 min before recording

**Great interview questions:**
- "Tell me about when you first realized..."
- "What's something most people get wrong about..."
- "Walk me through the exact process you used to..."
- "What would you do differently if starting today?"
- "What's an unpopular opinion you hold about..."
