## Problem

Most webinars are boring PowerPoint presentations that drive no action. Attendees leave without converting, and the content isn't leveraged beyond the live session. A great webinar combines engaging delivery, clear conversion paths, and effective content repurposing.

---

## Framework

Successful webinar execution follows:

```
DELIVER   -> Engaging, valuable presentation
CONVERT   -> Follow-up for action
REPURPOSE -> Extract more value from content
```

### Step 1: Deliver an Engaging Webinar

**Before going live:**
- [ ] Test audio/video 15 min before
- [ ] Have slides ready in presenter mode
- [ ] Prepare Q&A answers for common questions
- [ ] Have backup plan (co-host can take over)
- [ ] Clear notifications, close other apps

**Engagement tactics:**

| When | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| Start | Poll about their situation |
| Every 10 min | Question to audience |
| Mid-point | Interactive exercise |
| Throughout | React to comments |
| End | Final poll/survey |

**Presentation tips:**
- Energy higher than normal (camera dampens)
- Look at camera, not screen
- Stand if possible
- Use stories and examples
- Show, don't just tell
- Pause for emphasis

### Step 2: Convert Attendees

**The offer:**
- Special webinar-only discount
- Extended trial period
- Bonus content for attendees
- Limited-time availability

**CTA delivery:**
```
"For those ready to [desired outcome]..."
[Show offer slide with clear next step]
"This is only available until [deadline]."
"If you're not sure, that's okay - [objection handling]."
```

**Post-webinar sequence:**

| Timing | Email |
|--------|-------|
| Immediately | Thank you + replay link + offer |
| Day 1 | Key takeaways + resources + offer |
| Day 2 | Case study + testimonial + offer |
| Day 3 | FAQ + final deadline reminder |
| Day 5 | Deadline extension (if using) |

### Step 3: Repurpose Content

**Extract more value:**

| Asset | How to Create |
|-------|---------------|
| Blog post | Transcribe and edit key section |
| YouTube video | Upload recording with timestamps |
| Podcast episode | Audio-only version |
| Social clips | Cut 1-2 min highlights |
| Infographic | Visual summary of key points |
| Email content | Newsletter edition |
| Slide deck | Share on SlideShare |
