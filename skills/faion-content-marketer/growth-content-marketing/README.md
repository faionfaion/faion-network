## Problem

You need consistent traffic but can not afford to pay for every visitor. Without content marketing, you're stuck in a paid acquisition treadmill where costs keep rising.

Most content marketing fails because it's random. You publish without a strategy, write for yourself instead of your audience, and give up before seeing results.

---

## Framework

Content marketing follows the Content Flywheel:

```
Research → Create → Distribute → Measure → Iterate
    ↑                                        ↓
    ←←←←←←←← Learn & Improve ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

### Step 1: Content Strategy

**Define your content pillars (3-5 themes):**

```markdown
## Content Pillars for [Product]

1. **[Pillar 1]** - [Why it matters to ICP]
2. **[Pillar 2]** - [Why it matters to ICP]
3. **[Pillar 3]** - [Why it matters to ICP]

Example for project management tool:
1. Remote work productivity
2. Team collaboration
3. Project planning
```

**Content types by funnel stage:**

| Stage | Goal | Content Types |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **Awareness** | Attract | Blog posts, social, podcasts |
| **Consideration** | Educate | Guides, comparisons, webinars |
| **Decision** | Convert | Case studies, demos, free trials |
| **Retention** | Keep | Tutorials, updates, community |

### Step 2: Keyword Research

**Find topics your audience searches for:**

1. List problems your product solves
2. Use keyword tools to find search volume
3. Check competitor content for gaps
4. Prioritize by: volume, difficulty, intent

**Keyword intent types:**

| Intent | Example | Content Type |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Informational** | "how to manage remote teams" | Blog post, guide |
| **Commercial** | "best project management tools" | Comparison, listicle |
| **Transactional** | "notion pricing" | Product page, pricing |
| **Navigational** | "slack login" | Homepage |

**Prioritization matrix:**

```
High volume + Low difficulty = Quick wins (do first)
High volume + High difficulty = Long-term plays
Low volume + Low difficulty = Easy wins
Low volume + High difficulty = Skip
```

### Step 3: Content Creation

**Blog post structure:**

```markdown
# [Keyword-rich headline]

[Hook - why this matters]

## What is [Topic]?
[Definition for beginners]

## Why [Topic] Matters
[Benefits, consequences of not doing it]

## How to [Topic]: Step-by-Step
### Step 1: [Action]
### Step 2: [Action]
### Step 3: [Action]

## [Topic] Examples
[Real examples with screenshots]

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
[What not to do]

## Tools for [Topic]
[Relevant tools]

## Conclusion
[Summary + CTA]
```

**Content quality checklist:**

- [ ] Better than top 3 results
- [ ] Has original insights/data
- [ ] Includes visuals (images, diagrams)
- [ ] Scannable (headers, bullets, bold)
- [ ] Has internal/external links
- [ ] Clear CTA at end

### Step 4: Content Distribution

**Owned channels:**
- Email newsletter

- Social profiles

**Earned channels:**
- Guest posts
- Podcast appearances
- PR/press
- Community shares

**Paid amplification:**
- Promoted posts
- Content discovery (Outbrain, Taboola)
- Retargeting

**Distribution checklist:**

```markdown
## New Content Distribution

### Day 1 (Publish)
- [ ] Publish on blog
- [ ] Send to email list
- [ ] Share on Twitter/X
- [ ] Share on LinkedIn
- [ ] Post in relevant communities

### Week 1

- [ ] Submit to newsletters
- [ ] Answer related questions (Reddit, Quora)

### Ongoing

- [ ] Internal link from related posts
- [ ] Update with new information
```

### Step 5: Measurement

**Key metrics:**

| Metric | What It Shows | Tool |
|--------|---------------|------|
| Traffic | Reach | Google Analytics |
| Time on page | Engagement | Google Analytics |
| Bounce rate | Relevance | Google Analytics |
| Conversions | Impact | GA + Product |
| Backlinks | Authority | Ahrefs, Moz |
| Rankings | SEO success | Search Console |

**Content ROI formula:**

```
Content ROI = (Revenue from Content - Content Cost) / Content Cost x 100%

Example:
- Blog drives 1,000 visits/month
- 2% convert to trial, 10% trial to paid
- 20 customers x $50/month = $1,000 MRR
- Content cost: $500/month (writer + tools)
- ROI = ($1,000 - $500) / $500 = 100%
```
