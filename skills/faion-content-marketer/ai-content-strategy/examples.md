# AI Content Strategy - Examples

## Example 1: SaaS Content Stack

**Company:** Project management tool (competing with Asana, Monday.com)

**Generic AI Content (DON'T DO):**
```
"Project management is important for teams. It helps organize tasks
and improve collaboration. Using tools like Asana, Monday.com, and
Notion can help manage projects effectively."
```

**Differentiated AI + Human Content (DO THIS):**
```
"Why remote teams should ditch spreadsheet-based project tracking
(and what we learned migrating 200+ teams)

At [Company], we watched teams waste 8+ hours/week on project updates
in spreadsheets. Here's what we discovered...

[First-hand case study: Team A's process]
[Proprietary data: Our anonymized dataset of 1,000 teams]
[Expert quote from industry researcher]
[Our contrarian take: Why most project tools fail]
[Real numbers: Time saved by migrating]
```

**AI Role:** Generate structure, research competitor approaches, optimize SEO
**Human Role:** Add case studies, insert company data, share experiences, take positions

## Example 2: Content Marketing Topic

**Topic:** Email newsletter growth strategy

**Generic Version:**
```
"Email newsletters are important for building an audience.
You should write good content, send regularly, and grow your list.
Here are some best practices for growing your email list."
```

**Differentiated Version with AI:**
```
"We grew our email list from 1k to 50k in 12 months. Here's what worked.

Problem: We had great content but awful list growth (2% month-over-month)

What we tried:
1. Lead magnets (everyone does this)
   - Result: 3% signup rate
   - Why it failed: Too generic, not specific enough

2. Content + community (our breakthrough)
   - Result: 12% signup rate
   - How we did it: [Specific examples]
   - Lessons: [What surprised us]

3. Paid amplification strategy (controversial take)
   - Why newsletters are the new SEO
   - Cost per subscriber analysis
   - ROI vs. social media

[Real metrics, screenshots, anonymized data]
[Interview with 3 newsletter creators]
[What didn't work and why]
```

## Example 3: E-E-A-T Signals in Practice

**Original (No E-E-A-T):**
```
"AI content is becoming more popular. Companies are using AI to create
content at scale. However, you need to be careful about quality."
```

**With E-E-A-T Signals:**
```
"AI content is becoming more popular. Last year we tested 500+ AI-generated
pieces across our portfolio [EXPERIENCE].

As a content marketer with 8 years of SEO experience [EXPERTISE], I've seen
a clear pattern: AI content works best when combined with human expertise [EXPERIENCE].

According to our internal testing (validated by [Authority Source] findings) [AUTHORITATIVENESS],
the effectiveness of AI content depends on 3 factors:
1. [Factor 1 - backed by our data]
2. [Factor 2 - backed by industry research]
3. [Factor 3 - backed by case studies]

and openly share our failures alongside wins [TRUSTWORTHINESS].

## Example 4: AI Prompt for Content Creation

**Good Prompt (Provides Context):**
```
You are writing for marketing leaders at B2B SaaS companies (50-500 employees).
They're frustrated with AI content that sounds generic and doesn't drive results.

Topic: How to use AI for content without sounding generic

Your angle: Focus on the proprietary data + human expertise combination
Target audience comprehension: 6th-8th grade reading level

Structure:
1. Problem: Why most AI content fails (common mistake we see)
2. The shift: From "prompt and publish" to "AI-assisted creation"
3. Our approach: Specific workflow with real examples
4. Results: Metrics showing differentiation works
5. Next steps: How to implement

Tone: Helpful, specific, opinionated
Include: 1 specific example, 1 data point, 1 expert opinion
Avoid: Generic advice, hypotheticals, industry jargon

Output: 800 words in markdown
```

**Bad Prompt (Vague):**
```
Write about AI content.
Make it helpful and specific.
Include examples.
```

## Example 5: Transformation - Weak to Strong

**Stage 1: Initial AI Draft**
```
"AI content is useful for businesses. It can save time and create more content.
Using ChatGPT or other AI tools can help with brainstorming and drafting."
```

**Stage 2: Human Add First-Hand Experience**
```
"When we started using AI for content in 2023, we thought we could just
'prompt and publish.' That failed immediately. Here's what actually worked:

We tested AI across 50+ pieces. The winners all had one thing in common:
human expertise added proprietary insights the AI couldn't generate."
```

**Stage 3: Add Proprietary Data**
```
"When we started using AI for content in 2023, we tested it across 50+ pieces.
Result: AI-only content ranked poorly. But AI + human expertise? Different story.

Our data:
- AI only: 2% CTR, 15% rankings drop within 6 months
- AI + human insights: 7% CTR, 35% improvement in rankings
- Differentiator: Articles with proprietary data ranked 3x better

Why? Google's E-E-A-T update rewards experience and original research."
```

**Stage 4: Add Expert Voice & Opinion**
```
"When we started using AI for content in 2023, we tested it across 50+ pieces.
AI-only content ranked poorly. But AI + human expertise? Different story.

Our data shows a clear 3x ranking advantage for differentiated content.
But here's what surprised us: The best-performing pieces weren't the longest
or most comprehensive. They were the ones with specific opinions.

Example: Instead of 'here are 10 tips,' we wrote 'why tip #5 is a waste of time'
(backed by our data). That piece gets 2x the engagement.

My take: The next wave of AI content will be ruthlessly specific,
heavily opinionated, and deeply experiential. Generic is dead."
