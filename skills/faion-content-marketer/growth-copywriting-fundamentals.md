## Problem

Your product is great but your words don't sell it. Visitors read your landing page and leave confused. Emails go unopened. Ads get ignored. You know what you do, but you can't explain it compellingly.

Good copy is the difference between "meh" and "take my money." It's a learnable skill with proven frameworks.

---

## Framework

Great copywriting follows a simple structure:

```
KNOW      -> Deeply understand your audience
HOOK      -> Grab attention in seconds
HOLD      -> Keep them reading
CONVINCE  -> Build desire and handle objections
CONVERT   -> Make the ask crystal clear
```

### Step 1: Know Your Audience

**Before writing anything:**

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Who are they? | Demographics, psychographics |
| What do they want? | Desired outcome |
| What's stopping them? | Obstacles, objections |
| How do they talk? | Language, jargon level |
| Where are they now? | Awareness stage |

**Voice of Customer (VoC) research:**
- Customer interviews
- Support tickets
- Reviews (yours and competitors)
- Reddit, forums, Twitter
- Survey responses

**Document exact phrases they use:**
```
"I'm so frustrated with..."
"I wish I could..."
"What I really need is..."
"My biggest fear is..."
```

### Step 2: Core Copywriting Formulas

**AIDA (Classic):**
```
Attention: Grab them with headline
Interest: Hook them with relevance
Desire: Build want with benefits
Action: Tell them what to do
```

**PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution):**
```
Problem: State the pain
Agitate: Make it worse (emotional)
Solution: Introduce your solution
```

**4 Ps:**
```
Promise: What you'll deliver
Picture: Paint the future state
Proof: Why they should believe
Push: Drive to action
```

**BAB (Before-After-Bridge):**
```
Before: Current painful state
After: Desired future state
Bridge: Your product bridges the gap
```

### Step 3: Writing Headlines

**The headline is 80% of your copy's effectiveness.**

**Headline formulas:**

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| How to [Benefit] | "How to Write Copy That Converts" |
| [Number] Ways to [Result] | "7 Ways to Double Your Signups" |
| The Secret to [Outcome] | "The Secret to Landing Page Success" |
| [Question]? | "Struggling to Get Customers?" |
| Why [Surprising Claim] | "Why Your Best Copy Gets Ignored" |
| [Result] Without [Pain] | "Get Customers Without Cold Calling" |
| [Result] in [Timeframe] | "Double Revenue in 90 Days" |
| Stop [Problem] | "Stop Losing Visitors at Checkout" |

**Headline testing:**
- Write 10 versions minimum
- Test specificity vs. curiosity
- Use numbers when possible
- Include benefit, not feature

### Step 4: Write Body Copy

**Structure for clarity:**

```
Short sentences.
Even shorter paragraphs.

One idea per paragraph.
Max 3-4 sentences.

Use subheads to break up text.
Bullet points are your friends.
```

**Power words:**

| Category | Words |
|----------|-------|
| **Urgency** | Now, today, immediately, limited |
| **Exclusivity** | Secret, insider, members-only |
| **Trust** | Proven, guaranteed, tested |
| **Ease** | Simple, quick, easy, effortless |
| **Results** | Transform, unlock, discover |
| **Emotion** | Imagine, feel, experience |

**Benefit vs Feature:**

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 256-bit encryption | Your data is bank-level secure |
| AI-powered | Get answers in seconds |
| Cloud-based | Access from anywhere |
| 24/7 support | Help whenever you need it |

**Formula:** Feature → So what? → Benefit

### Step 5: Handle Objections

**Common objections and responses:**

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Too expensive" | Show ROI, compare to alternatives |
| "Don't have time" | Show time saved |
| "Not sure it'll work" | Testimonials, case studies |
| "Not for me" | Speak directly to their situation |
| "Can I trust you?" | Social proof, guarantees |

**Objection handling copy:**

```
"But what if it doesn't work for me?"
Every strategy here has been tested with 500+ founders just like you.
If it doesn't work, you get a full refund. No questions asked.
```

### Step 6: Write Calls to Action

**CTA best practices:**

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| **Action verb** | Start with "Get", "Start", "Claim" |
| **Specificity** | "Start Free Trial" vs "Submit" |
| **Benefit hint** | "Get My Free Guide" |
| **Low friction** | Reduce perceived commitment |

**CTA examples:**

| Weak | Strong |
