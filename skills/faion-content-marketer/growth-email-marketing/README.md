## Problem

You're building an audience on social platforms you don't control. Without email, you're one algorithm change away from losing access to your audience.

Most email marketing fails because it's spammy, irregular, or purely promotional. Subscribers unsubscribe, and your list becomes worthless.

---

## Framework

Email marketing follows the Value-First approach:

```
Build List → Nurture → Segment → Convert → Retain
     ↓           ↓          ↓         ↓         ↓
  Opt-ins    Value     Behavior   Offers   Loyalty
```

### Step 1: Build Your List

**Lead magnet types:**

| Type | Works For | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Checklist** | Quick wins | "10-Point SEO Checklist" |
| **Template** | Save time | "Email Swipe File" |
| **Guide/Ebook** | Deep knowledge | "Complete Guide to X" |
| **Mini-course** | Learning | "5-Day Email Course" |
| **Tool/Calculator** | Utility | "ROI Calculator" |
| **Webinar** | High-intent | "Live Workshop" |

**Opt-in form best practices:**

- Single field (email only) for max conversions
- Clear value proposition
- Privacy assurance
- Above-the-fold placement
- Exit-intent popup (use sparingly)

### Step 2: Welcome Sequence

**5-email welcome sequence:**

```
Day 0: Deliver lead magnet + introduce yourself
Day 1: Share your story + philosophy
Day 3: Provide valuable content (best blog post)
Day 5: Case study or social proof
Day 7: Soft pitch or next step
```

**Welcome email template:**

```

Day -1: Early bird / reminder
Day 0: LAUNCH + full details
Day 1: FAQ / objection handling
