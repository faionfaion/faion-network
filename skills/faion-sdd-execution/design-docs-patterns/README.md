# Design Docs Patterns (Big Tech)

## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Mechanically format design doc | haiku | Pattern-based formatting application |
| Compare design doc alternatives | sonnet | Medium-complexity analysis of trade-offs |
| Review design doc completeness | sonnet | Medium-complexity quality assessment |
| Facilitate design review meeting | opus | Complex facilitation and strategic decision |
| Generate design doc from outline | haiku | Template-based mechanical document generation |

### Problem

Design docs written without structure lead to:
- Inconsistent quality across teams
- Missing critical considerations
- Difficult cross-team review
- No clear approval process

### Framework

#### Design Doc Purpose

"Our job is not to produce code per se, but rather to solve problems. Unstructured text may be the better tool for solving problems early when changes are still cheap."

#### Design Doc Functions

1. **Early issue identification** - Catch design issues when changes are cheap
2. **Consensus building** - Achieve agreement across organization
3. **Knowledge sharing** - Document decisions for future team members
4. **Onboarding** - Help new engineers understand system

#### Company Approaches

| Company | Name | Key Features |
|---------|------|--------------|
| **Google** | Design Doc | Informal, collaborative, focuses on "why" |
| **Uber** | ERD (Engineering Review Doc) | Formal approvers, service SLAs required |
| **Amazon** | 6-pager | Narrative format, silent reading |
| **Rust/OSS** | RFC | Community feedback, explicit process |

#### Uber RFC/ERD Process

```
AUTHOR WRITES -> CIRCULATE -> COLLECT FEEDBACK -> APPROVE -> IMPLEMENT
                    |              |               |
               Mailing list   Comments in doc   Approvers sign
               (segmented)    Add objections    or object
```

### Templates

#### Design Doc Template (Google-style)

```markdown
# Design Doc: [Project Name]

**Author:** [Name]
**Reviewers:** [Names]
**Status:** Draft | In Review | Approved | Implemented
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

| [Name] | [Team] | [ ] | |
| [Name] | [Team] | [ ] | |
```

### Best Practices

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Silent reading** | Start review meetings with 10-15 min reading |
| **Inline comments** | Comment on specific sections, not general feedback |
| **Explicit approvers** | Define who must sign off |
| **Segmented distribution** | Send to relevant mailing lists only |
| **Templates by type** | Different templates for services, libraries, policies |
| **Keep it short** | 2-5 pages typically; longer needs justification |

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Design doc as spec | Keep separate: design doc (why/how), spec (what) |
| No alternatives section | Always document what you considered |
| Writing after implementation | Write before coding; cheap to change |
| Too many approvers | Keep under 10 participants |
