# Visibility of System Status

## Metadata
- **Category:** UX / Usability Heuristic #1
- **Difficulty:** Beginner
- **Tags:** #methodology #ux #heuristics #nielsen-norman #feedback
- **Agent:** faion-usability-agent

## Problem

Users click a button and nothing appears to happen. They wonder if the system is working. They click again, accidentally submitting twice. They abandon tasks because they cannot tell if progress is being made. Users feel anxious and out of control.

Without system status visibility:
- User confusion
- Repeated actions
- Abandoned tasks
- Frustration and distrust

---

## The Heuristic

**Usability Heuristic #1:** The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.

---

## Framework

### Key Principles

1. **Feedback for every action** - Users should know their input was received
2. **Timely response** - Feedback should come immediately
3. **Clear communication** - Status should be understandable
4. **Appropriate context** - Show what matters for the current task

### Response Time Guidelines

| Response Time | User Perception | Required Feedback |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| < 0.1 second | Instantaneous | Visual state change |
| 0.1-1 second | System is working | Loading indicator |
| 1-10 seconds | Wait is noticeable | Progress indicator |
| > 10 seconds | Long operation | Progress bar with percentage |

### Types of System Status

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Loading** | Operation in progress | Spinners, progress bars |
| **Success** | Action completed | Checkmarks, success messages |
| **Error** | Something went wrong | Error messages, alerts |
| **Progress** | Multi-step process | Step indicators, progress bars |
| **State** | Current situation | Online/offline, saved status |

---

## Implementation Patterns

### Loading Indicators

**Spinner:** For short, indeterminate waits
```
Use when: 1-3 seconds, unknown duration
Show: Animated spinner with "Loading..." text
```

**Progress Bar:** For longer, measurable operations
```
Use when: > 3 seconds, known duration
Show: Percentage, time remaining, cancel option
```

**Skeleton Screen:** For content loading
```
Use when: Loading complex content layouts
Show: Gray placeholder shapes matching expected content
```

### Success Feedback

**Inline confirmation:**
```
Button: "Save" → "Saved!" with checkmark → returns to "Save"
```

**Toast notification:**
```
"Changes saved successfully" - appears, auto-dismisses
```

**Page transition:**
```
Redirect to confirmation page with summary
```

### Error Feedback

**Inline validation:**
```
Show error next to specific field immediately
```

**Summary notification:**
```
"Please fix 3 errors before continuing" with links
```

### State Indicators

**Connection status:**
```
Green dot: Online
Yellow dot: Connecting...
Red dot: Offline (with retry option)
```

**Document status:**
```
"Draft" | "Saving..." | "All changes saved"
```

### Status Feedback Audit

```markdown
# System Status Audit: [Feature/Page]

**Date:** [Date]
**Reviewer:** [Name]

## Actions Reviewed

| Action | Feedback Present | Feedback Type | Timing | Notes |
|--------|------------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| [Action] | Y/N | [Type] | [Time] | [Notes] |

## Gaps Identified

| Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| [Issue] | H/M/L | [Fix] |

## Recommendations Summary
- [Priority recommendation 1]

## Examples

### Good Examples

**File upload:**
1. Click "Upload" - button shows "Uploading..."
2. Progress bar appears with percentage
3. File name visible with upload speed
4. Complete: checkmark + "Upload complete"
5. If error: specific error message + retry button

**Form submission:**
1. Click "Submit" - button disabled, shows spinner
2. Success: green banner "Form submitted successfully"
3. Error: red banner with specific error + form fields highlighted

### Bad Examples

**No feedback on click:**
- User clicks button
- Nothing visible happens
- User clicks again (duplicate submission)
- Eventually page changes

**Vague status:**
- "Please wait..." (how long?)
- "Processing..." (what?)
- Generic spinner (any progress?)

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **No loading indicator** - Button click with no response
2. **Feedback too slow** - Appears after 2+ seconds
3. **Unclear messaging** - "Error occurred" without details
4. **Missing error states** - What happens when it fails?
5. **Overloaded feedback** - Too many notifications at once

---

## Accessibility Considerations

- Use ARIA live regions for dynamic updates
- Do not rely solely on color for status
- Provide text alternatives for icons
- Ensure feedback is perceivable by screen readers
- Allow users to dismiss notifications

---

## Measurement

| Metric | How to Measure |
|--------|----------------|
| Task completion rate | % of users completing tasks |
| Repeated clicks | Double/triple submissions |
| Abandonment | Users leaving during loading |
| Support tickets | "Is it working?" inquiries |

---

## Checklist

- [ ] Every clickable element provides immediate feedback
- [ ] Loading states are visible for operations > 0.5 seconds
- [ ] Progress indicators show for operations > 3 seconds
- [ ] Success states confirm action completion
- [ ] Error states explain what went wrong
- [ ] Current state (online/offline, saved/unsaved) is visible
