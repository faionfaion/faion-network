## Problem

High candidate drop-off at various stages leads to long time-to-fill and lost talent. Without funnel visibility, you can't identify where candidates are leaking out or optimize the process effectively.

---

## Framework

### The Recruitment Funnel Stages

```
AWARENESS      → Candidates learn about you
     ↓ (Conversion: varies by channel)
APPLICATION    → Candidates apply
     ↓ (Conversion: 8-12%)
SCREENING      → Resume review, initial call
     ↓ (Conversion: 20-30%)
INTERVIEW      → Technical/culture interviews
     ↓ (Conversion: 15-25%)
OFFER          → Extend offer
     ↓ (Conversion: 85-95%)
ONBOARDING     → Accept and start
```

### Drop-off Analysis

**Highest drop-off:** Offer → Accept (83%, below 85% benchmark)

**Root cause analysis:**
- 2 declined for compensation
- 1 accepted competing offer (faster process)

**Recommended actions:**
1. Review compensation against market
2. Reduce time from final interview to offer
