## Problem

Candidates don't know why they should choose your company over competitors. Without a clear Employee Value Proposition, you compete on salary alone and lose to bigger companies with deeper pockets.

An EVP defines the unique value employees receive in exchange for their skills and commitment. It's the foundation of your employer brand.

| **Work Environment** | Day-to-day experience | Flexibility, tools, team, office |

### Gartner's "Human Deal" Framework

Evolution from traditional EVP to human-centered approach:

| Traditional EVP | Human Deal |
|----------------|------------|
| What we offer | Why it matters to you |
| Transactional | Emotional connection |
| One-size-fits-all | Personalized |
| Company-centric | Employee-centric |

**Four Human Deal Dimensions:**

1. **Deeper Connections** — Help employees feel understood through family/community support
2. **Radical Flexibility** — Autonomy in all aspects of work
3. **Personal Growth** — Grow as people, not just professionals
4. **Holistic Well-being** — Physical, mental, financial, social wellness
