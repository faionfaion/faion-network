## Problem

New hires are overwhelmed in their first month. Without clear structure, they don't know what to learn, who to meet, or how to measure success. This leads to confusion, slow ramp-up, and early turnover.

Research shows 20% of turnover happens in the first 45 days, but effective onboarding can improve retention by 82% and productivity by 70%.
