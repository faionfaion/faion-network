## Problem

After the initial 30-day learning phase, new hires need clear progression paths to become productive contributors. Without structure for days 31-90, they plateau or work below capacity, delaying full productivity and ROI on hiring.

---

## Framework

### The Two Phases

| Phase | Days | Focus | Goal |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| **Contribute** | 31-60 | Apply | Make initial contributions |
| **Execute** | 61-90 | Deliver | Work independently, hit goals |

## Phase 2: Days 31-60 (Contributing)

**Primary objective:** Apply knowledge, make initial impact.

| **Collaboration** | Contribute actively in meetings |
| **Relationships** | Build cross-functional connections |
| **Skills** | Identify and address knowledge gaps |
| **Feedback** | Regular 1:1s, early course correction |

**Key outcomes:**
- Complete first project successfully
- Demonstrate core job skills
- Receive and act on feedback
- Propose at least one improvement
- Have clear 90-day goals

---

## Phase 3: Days 61-90 (Executing)

**Primary objective:** Work independently, deliver measurable results.

| Category | Activities |
|----------|------------|
| **Independence** | Handle responsibilities with minimal guidance |
| **Delivery** | Complete major project or milestone |
| **Initiative** | Proactively identify opportunities |
| **Leadership** | Help onboard newer team members |
| **Planning** | Set goals for next quarter |

**Key outcomes:**
