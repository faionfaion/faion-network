## Problem

New hires flounder without clear direction in their first months. Without structure, they don't know what success looks like, leading to slow ramp-up, frustration, and early turnover.

Research shows 20% of turnover happens in the first 45 days, but effective onboarding can improve retention by 82% and productivity by 70%.
