# STAR Interview Method

## Problem

Interviews produce vague, unhelpful answers that don't predict job performance. Candidates give generic responses, and interviewers can't evaluate actual past behavior.

The STAR method provides a structured approach to behavioral interviewing that reveals how candidates actually handled real situations—the best predictor of future performance.

---

## Framework

### The STAR Components

| Component | Definition | Interviewer Prompt |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **S**ituation | The context or background | "Tell me about a time when..." |
| **T**ask | The specific challenge or responsibility | "What was your role/responsibility?" |
| **A**ction | What the candidate specifically did | "What did you do?" |
| **R**esult | The outcome and what they learned | "What was the result?" |

### The Interview Flow

```
1. ASK the behavioral question
   "Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a difficult stakeholder."

2. LISTEN for the Situation
   ✓ Specific context
   ✓ Timeframe
   ✓ Who was involved

3. PROBE for the Task
   "What was your specific responsibility?"
   "What were you trying to accomplish?"

4. DIG INTO the Action
   "Walk me through exactly what you did."
   "What was YOUR role, not the team's?"

5. UNDERSTAND the Result
   "What was the outcome?"
   "What metrics can you share?"
   "What did you learn?"
```

### Follow-Up Questions

| Purpose | Question |
|---------|----------|
| Clarify | "Can you be more specific about...?" |
| Probe actions | "What was YOUR contribution vs the team's?" |
| Quantify | "What were the specific numbers/results?" |
| Learn | "What would you do differently?" |
| Verify | "Who else was involved that I could speak with?" |

### STAR vs. Incomplete Answers

| Type | Example | Issue |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Good STAR** | "When X happened (S), I was responsible for Y (T), so I did A, B, C (A), resulting in 30% improvement (R)" | Complete, specific |
| **Missing Action** | "The project was struggling, so we fixed it" | No personal contribution |
| **Missing Result** | "I led a team and we worked hard" | No measurable outcome |
| **Hypothetical** | "I would have done X, Y, Z" | Not actual past behavior |

## Examples

### Example 1: Strong STAR Response

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you had to manage a project that was falling behind."

**Response:**
- **Situation:** "Last year, our product launch was 6 weeks behind schedule due to unexpected technical debt. The CEO was briefing investors the following month."
- **Task:** "As project lead, I needed to get us back on track without burning out the team or cutting critical features."
- **Action:** "I did three things: First, I mapped all remaining work and identified the true critical path—turns out 40% of planned features weren't actually needed for launch. Second, I negotiated with stakeholders to defer nice-to-haves. Third, I restructured the team into two-day sprints with daily standups to increase velocity."
- **Result:** "We launched 1 week ahead of the revised schedule. The CEO's investor meeting went well, and we maintained 95% team retention during the crunch."

**Why it's strong:**
- Specific context with stakes
- Clear personal responsibility
- Multiple concrete actions
- Quantified results

### Example 2: Weak Response (Before Probing)

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you resolved a conflict."

**Response:** "I'm good at resolving conflicts. I always try to understand both sides and find a win-win solution."

**Why it's weak:**
- Hypothetical, not actual
- No specific situation
- No actions taken
- No results

**Probing to improve:**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "Walk me through what happened."
- "What did YOU specifically do?"

### Example 3: Red Flag Response

**Question:** "Describe a time you made a mistake at work."

**Response:** "I don't really make mistakes. I'm very careful and detail-oriented. If anything goes wrong, it's usually because of others not doing their part."

**Red flags:**
- Lack of self-awareness
- Blames others
- Can't give specific example
- May indicate poor accountability
