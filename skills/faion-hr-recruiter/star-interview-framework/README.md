# STAR Interview Framework

## Problem

Interviews produce vague, unhelpful answers that don't predict job performance. Candidates give generic responses, and interviewers can't evaluate actual past behavior.

The STAR method provides a structured approach to behavioral interviewing that reveals how candidates actually handled real situations—the best predictor of future performance.

---

## Framework

### The STAR Components

| Component | Definition | Interviewer Prompt |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **S**ituation | The context or background | "Tell me about a time when..." |
| **T**ask | The specific challenge or responsibility | "What was your role/responsibility?" |
| **A**ction | What the candidate specifically did | "What did you do?" |
| **R**esult | The outcome and what they learned | "What was the result?" |

### The Interview Flow

```
1. ASK the behavioral question
   "Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a difficult stakeholder."

2. LISTEN for the Situation
   ✓ Specific context
   ✓ Timeframe
   ✓ Who was involved

3. PROBE for the Task
   "What was your specific responsibility?"
   "What were you trying to accomplish?"

4. DIG INTO the Action
   "Walk me through exactly what you did."
   "What was YOUR role, not the team's?"

5. UNDERSTAND the Result
   "What was the outcome?"
   "What metrics can you share?"
   "What did you learn?"
```

### Follow-Up Questions

| Purpose | Question |
|---------|----------|
| Clarify | "Can you be more specific about...?" |
| Probe actions | "What was YOUR contribution vs the team's?" |
| Quantify | "What were the specific numbers/results?" |
| Learn | "What would you do differently?" |
| Verify | "Who else was involved that I could speak with?" |

### STAR vs. Incomplete Answers

| Type | Example | Issue |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Good STAR** | "When X happened (S), I was responsible for Y (T), so I did A, B, C (A), resulting in 30% improvement (R)" | Complete, specific |
| **Missing Action** | "The project was struggling, so we fixed it" | No personal contribution |
| **Missing Result** | "I led a team and we worked hard" | No measurable outcome |
| **Hypothetical** | "I would have done X, Y, Z" | Not actual past behavior |
