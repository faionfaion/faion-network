## Problem

Unstructured interviews are unreliable predictors of job performance. When interviewers ask different questions and evaluate subjectively, hiring becomes inconsistent and biased. Studies show structured interviews are 2x more predictive of job performance.

---

## Framework

### Structured Interview Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Same questions** | All candidates answer identical questions |
| **Job-related** | Questions directly tied to competencies |
| **Standardized scoring** | Rating scale with clear criteria |
| **Multiple interviewers** | Panel reduces individual bias |
| **Independent evaluation** | Score before discussing |
| **Evidence-based decisions** | Focus on examples, not impressions |

### Design Process

```
1. DEFINE JOB REQUIREMENTS
   └── Identify 4-6 key competencies

2. CREATE QUESTIONS
   └── 2-3 behavioral questions per competency

3. BUILD SCORECARD
   └── 1-5 scale with behavioral anchors

4. TRAIN INTERVIEWERS
   └── Calibration session, practice scoring

5. EXECUTE CONSISTENTLY
   └── Same process for every candidate

6. DEBRIEF OBJECTIVELY
   └── Independent scores before discussion
```

### Competency Mapping

| Role Level | Typical Competencies |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Individual Contributor** | Technical skills, problem-solving, communication, collaboration |
| **Manager** | Leadership, delegation, developing others, strategic thinking |
| **Executive** | Vision, influence, business acumen, change management |

### Question Types

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Behavioral** | Past performance | "Tell me about a time..." |
| **Situational** | Hypothetical scenarios | "What would you do if..." |
| **Technical** | Skill assessment | "How would you design..." |
| **Motivational** | Fit and values | "Why do you want to..." |
