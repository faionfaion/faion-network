## Examples

### Example 1: Strong STAR Response

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you had to manage a project that was falling behind."

**Response:**
- **Situation:** "Last year, our product launch was 6 weeks behind schedule due to unexpected technical debt. The CEO was briefing investors the following month."
- **Task:** "As project lead, I needed to get us back on track without burning out the team or cutting critical features."
- **Action:** "I did three things: First, I mapped all remaining work and identified the true critical path—turns out 40% of planned features weren't actually needed for launch. Second, I negotiated with stakeholders to defer nice-to-haves. Third, I restructured the team into two-day sprints with daily standups to increase velocity."
- **Result:** "We launched 1 week ahead of the revised schedule. The CEO's investor meeting went well, and we maintained 95% team retention during the crunch."

**Why it's strong:**
- Specific context with stakes
- Clear personal responsibility
- Multiple concrete actions
- Quantified results

### Example 2: Weak Response (Before Probing)

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you resolved a conflict."

**Response:** "I'm good at resolving conflicts. I always try to understand both sides and find a win-win solution."

**Why it's weak:**
- Hypothetical, not actual
- No specific situation
- No actions taken
- No results

**Probing to improve:**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "Walk me through what happened."
- "What did YOU specifically do?"

### Example 3: Red Flag Response

**Question:** "Describe a time you made a mistake at work."

**Response:** "I don't really make mistakes. I'm very careful and detail-oriented. If anything goes wrong, it's usually because of others not doing their part."

**Red flags:**
- Lack of self-awareness
- Blames others
- Can't give specific example
- May indicate poor accountability

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Define 4-6 key competencies for role
- [ ] Create 2-3 STAR questions per competency
- [ ] Train interviewers on STAR technique

- [ ] Practice probing follow-ups
- [ ] Use same questions for all candidates
- [ ] Document responses during interview
- [ ] Score before discussing with others
- [ ] Focus on evidence, not impressions

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Accepting hypotheticals | Doesn't predict behavior | "Can you give a real example?" |
| Leading questions | Suggests desired answer | Use neutral, open questions |
| Not probing | Missing critical details | Always ask follow-ups |
| Interviewer talking too much | Candidate can't demonstrate | 80/20 rule (candidate talks 80%) |
| Judging delivery, not content | Rewards polish over substance | Focus on what they DID |
| Forgetting to ask Result | Missing outcome data | Always close the loop |

## Interview Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Candidate Goes Off-Track

**Problem:** Candidate rambles without structure.

**Solution:**
```
Interviewer: "Let me pause you there. Can you start by describing
the specific situation you were in?"

[Listen for Situation]

"Great. And what was your specific responsibility in that situation?"

[Listen for Task]

"Now walk me through exactly what YOU did."
```

### Scenario 2: Team-Focused Response

**Problem:** Candidate says "we" instead of "I".

**Probing:**
```
"You mentioned the team did X. What was YOUR specific contribution?"
"What did YOU personally do vs what others did?"
"Walk me through YOUR role in that process."
```

### Scenario 3: No Measurable Result

**Problem:** Candidate describes actions but no outcome.

**Probing:**
```
"What was the end result of those actions?"
"Can you quantify the impact?"
"How did you measure success?"
"What feedback did you receive?"
```

---

## Practice Exercise

### For Interviewers

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you had to learn a new technology quickly."

**Evaluate this response:**
> "I had to learn React for a project. I watched some YouTube videos and
> read the documentation. It went well and I finished the project on time."

**Analysis:**
- **Situation:** ⚠️ Incomplete (why was it needed? what was the deadline?)
- **Task:** ⚠️ Unclear (what was the specific requirement?)
- **Action:** ⚠️ Vague (what specifically did they do beyond watching videos?)
- **Result:** ⚠️ Unmeasured (what does "went well" mean?)

**Better probing:**
```
"What was the context that required you to learn React?"
"What was the timeline you were working with?"
"Beyond videos and docs, what was your learning approach?"
"How did you know you had learned it well enough?"
"What was the outcome for the project?"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Double-Click Probing

When you need more depth:
```
Level 1: "Tell me about a time you led a difficult project."
[Listen to initial response]

Level 2: "You mentioned X was challenging. Can you double-click on that?"
[Get deeper into specific challenge]

Level 3: "Walk me through your thought process at that moment."
[Understand decision-making]
```

### Reference Check Verification

Note details you can verify later:
- Names of people involved
- Specific metrics/numbers
- Timeframes
- Projects/companies

Example: "You mentioned working with Sarah on that project. Would she
be someone I could speak with about your collaboration?"

### Red Flag Follow-Up

When you notice concerning patterns:
```
Pattern: Always blames others
Probe: "What would you have done differently in hindsight?"

Pattern: Can't give specific examples
Probe: "Let's focus on one specific time. Walk me through just that situation."

Pattern: Only talks about success
Probe: "Tell me about a time something didn't go as planned."
```

- [ ] Scores are calibrated
- [ ] Recommendation is clear

### Debrief Preparation

Bring to hiring committee:
- Specific STAR examples
- Quotes from candidate
