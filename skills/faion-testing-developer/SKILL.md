# Testing Developer Skill

Testing strategies and implementation covering unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, TDD workflow, and testing best practices.

## Purpose

Handles all aspects of software testing including test design, implementation, mocking, fixtures, and testing frameworks.

## When to Use

- Unit testing strategies
- Integration testing
- End-to-end (E2E) testing
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Mocking and stubbing
- Test fixtures and factories
- Security testing
- Code coverage analysis
- Language-specific testing (pytest, Jest, Go testing, etc.)
