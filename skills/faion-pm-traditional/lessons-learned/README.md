# Lessons Learned

## Metadata
- **Category:** Project Management Framework / Development Approach Performance Domain
- **Difficulty:** Beginner

## Problem

The same mistakes happen project after project. Good practices are discovered but forgotten. New team members repeat old errors. Knowledge leaves when people leave. Organizations do not get smarter over time.

Without lessons learned:
- Repeated failures
- Lost institutional knowledge
- No continuous improvement
- Stagnant practices

---

## Framework

### What are Lessons Learned?

Knowledge gained during a project that can benefit future projects.

**Types:**
- **What worked well** - Practices to repeat
- **What did not work** - Mistakes to avoid
- **What to do differently** - Improvements to make

### Step 1: Capture Throughout Project

Do not wait until the end. Capture lessons as they happen.

**Capture triggers:**
- After each milestone
- When problems occur
- When successes happen
- During retrospectives
- At project close

**Quick capture format:**
```markdown
Date: [Date]
Category: [Planning/Execution/Technical/Team/Vendor]
Lesson: [What we learned]
Impact: [How it affected project]
Recommendation: [What to do next time]
```

### Step 2: Conduct Lessons Learned Sessions

Schedule dedicated sessions:

**Session structure:**

| Phase | Duration | Activity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Opening | 5 min | Set ground rules, purpose |
| What worked | 15 min | Identify successes |
| What did not work | 15 min | Identify challenges |
| Root causes | 15 min | Understand why |
| Recommendations | 15 min | Define improvements |
| Actions | 10 min | Assign follow-up |
| Closing | 5 min | Summarize, thank team |

**Ground rules:**
- No blame, focus on process
- Specific examples, not vague opinions
- Equal participation
- Honest and constructive
- Confidential where appropriate

### Step 3: Categorize Lessons

Organize for easy retrieval:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Planning** | Estimation, requirements, scheduling |
| **Execution** | Development, testing, deployment |
| **Team** | Communication, collaboration, skills |
| **Technical** | Architecture, tools, technology |
| **Vendor** | Contracts, management, selection |
| **Stakeholder** | Engagement, expectations, communication |

### Step 4: Document Formally

Create permanent records:

```markdown
## Lesson: [Title]

**Project:** [Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**Category:** [Category]
**Impact Level:** [High/Medium/Low]

### Situation
[What happened - context and facts]

### Impact
[How it affected the project]

### Root Cause
[Why it happened]

### Lesson
[What we learned]

### Recommendation
[What to do differently in future]

### Supporting Evidence
- [Link to document]
- [Data or metrics]
```

### Step 5: Store and Share

Make lessons accessible:

**Storage options:**
- Knowledge base / wiki
- Shared drive with structure
- Project management tool
- Dedicated lessons learned database

**Sharing mechanisms:**
- Project close-out reports
- Team meetings
- Onboarding materials
- Best practice guides
- Newsletters or updates

### Step 6: Apply to Future Projects

Close the loop:

- Review relevant lessons at project start
- Include in planning checklists
- Update processes based on lessons
- Track whether lessons are being applied

### Lessons Learned Session Agenda

```markdown
# Lessons Learned Session: [Project Name]

**Date:** [Date]
**Time:** [Time] ([Duration])
**Facilitator:** [Name]
**Participants:** [Names]

## Agenda

| Time | Topic | Notes |

## Examples

### Example 1: Technical Lesson

**Situation:** Chose new framework without team experience.

**Impact:** Development took 40% longer than estimated due to learning curve.

**Root Cause:** Excitement about new technology, underestimated training time.

**Lesson:** New technology requires explicit time for team learning.

**Recommendation:** When introducing new tech, add 25% buffer to estimates and schedule dedicated training.

### Example 2: Process Lesson

**Situation:** No change control process at project start.

**Impact:** 15 scope changes accepted without impact analysis, causing 3-week delay.

**Root Cause:** Wanted to be flexible and responsive.

**Lesson:** Flexibility without process leads to chaos.

**Recommendation:** Always establish change control process at kickoff, even for small projects.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Only at project end** - Too late, details forgotten
2. **Blame sessions** - People stop sharing honestly
3. **Documented but never used** - Knowledge not accessible
4. **Too vague** - "Communication was bad" is not actionable
5. **No follow-up** - Lessons identified but not implemented

---

## Questions to Ask in Sessions

**What worked well:**
- What would you definitely do again?
- What processes helped us succeed?
- What tools or techniques were effective?

**What did not work:**
- What slowed us down?
- What would you do differently?
- What frustrated you?

**Root causes:**
- Why did this happen?
- What was the underlying issue?
- What could we have done to prevent it?

**Recommendations:**
- What specific change would help?
- Who should implement this?
- How do we measure success?

## Next Steps

After capturing lessons:
1. Document in permanent location
2. Share with relevant teams
3. Update checklists and templates
4. Brief future project managers
5. Connect to Benefits Realization methodology
