## Problem

Without structured planning, projects face:
- Scope creep from undefined boundaries
- Missed deliverables discovered too late
- Inaccurate estimates from unclear work
- Team confusion about what to build

## Framework

### What is WBS?

A Work Breakdown Structure breaks the project into smaller, manageable pieces:

```
Project
├── Phase 1: Discovery
│   ├── 1.1 Research
│   │   ├── 1.1.1 User interviews
│   │   └── 1.1.2 Competitor analysis
│   └── 1.2 Requirements
│       ├── 1.2.1 Functional specs
│       └── 1.2.2 Technical specs
└── Phase 2: Development
    ├── 2.1 Frontend
    └── 2.2 Backend
```

### Step 1: Start with Major Deliverables

What are the main outcomes?
- Working software
- Documentation
- Training materials
- Infrastructure

### Step 2: Decompose to Work Packages

Break each deliverable into smaller pieces until you reach the "work package" level.

**Work Package Criteria:**
- Assignable to one person/team
- Estimable (8-80 hours rule)
- Measurable completion
- Produces a tangible output

### Step 3: Create WBS Dictionary

For each work package, document:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ID | Unique identifier (1.2.3) |
| Name | Clear, action-oriented |
| Description | What's included/excluded |
| Acceptance Criteria | How to know it's done |
| Owner | Who's responsible |
| Estimate | Time/cost |
| Dependencies | What must come before |

### Step 4: Validate with 100% Rule

The 100% Rule: Each level must represent 100% of the parent.

**Example:**
- Project (100%)
  - Development (40%)
  - Testing (20%)
  - Documentation (15%)
  - Deployment (15%)
  - Training (10%)
  = 100%

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too detailed too early** - Start high-level, detail later
2. **Verb-based instead of noun-based** - WBS shows deliverables, not activities
3. **Missing the 100% rule** - Leaves gaps in scope
4. **No WBS dictionary** - Details get lost
5. **Treating WBS as schedule** - WBS shows what, not when
