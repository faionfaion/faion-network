## Problem

Stakeholders feel ignored until you need something from them. Key influencers become blockers because they were not involved. Supporters lose enthusiasm due to poor communication. Resisters actively undermine the project. You have a stakeholder list but no relationship strategy.

Without engagement planning:
- Stakeholders become obstacles
- Support erodes over time
- Resistance grows silently
- No champions for your project

---

## Framework

### Engagement Levels

| Level | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Unaware** | Does not know about project | No contact, no information |
| **Resistant** | Aware but opposed | Active opposition, blocks progress |
| **Neutral** | Aware but indifferent | Neither helps nor hinders |
| **Supportive** | Aware and supportive | Provides resources, advocates |
| **Leading** | Actively engaged champion | Drives adoption, removes barriers |

### Step 1: Assess Current Engagement

For each stakeholder (from M-PM-001):

| Stakeholder | Current Level | Desired Level | Gap |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|-----|
| CEO | Neutral | Supportive | +1 |
| IT Director | Resistant | Neutral | +1 |
| End Users | Unaware | Supportive | +2 |
| Project Sponsor | Supportive | Leading | +1 |

### Step 2: Understand Stakeholder Needs

For each stakeholder, understand:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| What do they want? | Align messaging |
| What concerns them? | Address fears |
| How do they like to communicate? | Choose channel |
| What motivates them? | Frame benefits |
| Who influences them? | Leverage relationships |

### Step 3: Develop Engagement Strategies

For each gap, plan how to move stakeholders:

**Moving from Resistant to Neutral:**
- Address concerns directly
- Involve in decisions
- Show respect for their position
- Find common ground

**Moving from Neutral to Supportive:**
- Demonstrate benefits to them
- Provide information and education
- Ask for their input
- Acknowledge their expertise

**Moving from Supportive to Leading:**
- Give visible roles
- Recognize contributions publicly
- Empower to make decisions
- Include in inner circle

### Step 4: Plan Engagement Activities

| Stakeholder | Current | Target | Strategy | Activity | Frequency |
|-------------|---------|--------|----------|----------|-----------|
| IT Director | Resistant | Neutral | Address concerns | 1:1 meetings | Weekly |
| End Users | Unaware | Supportive | Inform and involve | Training, demos | Bi-weekly |
| Sponsor | Supportive | Leading | Empower | Strategy sessions | Weekly |

### Step 5: Execute and Monitor

Track engagement over time:

```markdown
## Engagement Tracking: [Stakeholder Name]

| Date | Interaction | Response | Assessment |
|------|-------------|----------|------------|
| [Date] | [Meeting/Email] | [Their response] | [Current level] |
| [Date] | [Meeting/Email] | [Their response] | [Current level] |
```

**Warning signs:**
- Declining meeting attendance
- Delayed responses
- Negative comments in meetings
- Going around the project team

## Examples

### Example 1: Engaging a Resistant Stakeholder

**Situation:** IT Security Director blocks new cloud solution.

**Analysis:**
- Concern: Data security, compliance risk
- Motivation: Protect organization, maintain control
- Current level: Resistant

**Strategy:**
1. Acknowledge valid concerns (not dismiss)
2. Involve in security requirements definition
3. Provide vendor security certifications
4. Offer compliance review meeting
5. Give veto power on specific concerns

**Activities:**
- Week 1: 1:1 meeting to understand concerns
- Week 2: Security requirements workshop
- Week 3: Vendor security presentation
- Week 4: Review and adjust approach

**Outcome:** Moved to Neutral, then Supportive after concerns addressed.

### Example 2: Building Champions

**Situation:** Need department heads to drive adoption.

**Target stakeholders:**
- Sales Director (currently Supportive)
- Operations Manager (currently Neutral)
- HR Director (currently Neutral)

**Strategy for each:**

| Stakeholder | Current | Strategy | Activities |
|-------------|---------|----------|------------|
| Sales Director | Supportive | Elevate to Leading | Give speaking role at launch, feature in success story |
| Operations Manager | Neutral | Move to Supportive | Show efficiency gains, involve in pilot |
| HR Director | Neutral | Move to Supportive | Highlight employee benefits, include in change planning |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Treating all stakeholders the same** - One size does not fit all
2. **Ignoring resistant stakeholders** - They do not go away
3. **Only engaging when needed** - Relationship is transactional
4. **Not tracking engagement** - Surprises when attitude changes
5. **Assuming support is permanent** - Engagement requires maintenance

## Red Flags in Engagement

| Signal | Possible Meaning | Response |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Skips meetings | Disengaging | Direct outreach |
| Sends delegate | Reducing priority | Understand why |
| Negative in public | Active resistance | Private conversation |
| Goes to executives | Escalating concerns | Address immediately |

2. Track responses and adjust
3. Build relationships before you need them
4. Monitor for changes in attitude
5. Connect to M-PM-019 (Scope Management)
