## Problem

Projects fail when you do not know who has influence over your work. You make decisions without consulting key people. Someone important feels ignored and blocks your progress later. You waste time communicating with people who do not need updates.

Without a stakeholder register, you operate blind. You do not know who to inform, who to consult, or who can stop your project.

## Framework

### Step 1: Identify Stakeholders

List everyone affected by or affecting your project.

**Categories to consider:**
- Project team members
- Management and executives
- Customers and end users
- Suppliers and vendors
- Regulatory bodies
- Competitors (indirectly)

**Questions to ask:**
- Who funds this project?
- Who uses the final product?
- Who approves decisions?
- Who provides resources?
- Who might block progress?

### Step 2: Analyze Each Stakeholder

For each person or group, document:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Full name or group name |
| **Role** | Their position or function |
| **Interest** | What they care about |
| **Influence** | Power to affect project (High/Medium/Low) |
| **Impact** | How project affects them (High/Medium/Low) |
| **Attitude** | Supportive / Neutral / Resistant |

### Step 3: Map on Power-Interest Grid

Plot stakeholders on a 2x2 matrix:

```
HIGH POWER
    |
    | Manage Closely  |  Keep Satisfied
    | (High-High)     |  (High-Low)
    |-----------------|------------------
    | Keep Informed   |  Monitor
    | (Low-High)      |  (Low-Low)
    |
LOW POWER ----------- HIGH INTEREST --- LOW INTEREST
```

### Step 4: Define Engagement Strategy

For each quadrant:

| Quadrant | Strategy | Communication |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Manage Closely** | Active engagement, involve in decisions | Weekly or more |
| **Keep Satisfied** | Regular updates, no surprises | Bi-weekly |
| **Keep Informed** | Regular communication, gather feedback | Weekly status |
| **Monitor** | Minimal effort, watch for changes | Monthly summary |

### Step 5: Maintain the Register

- Review after each project phase
- Update when new stakeholders appear
- Adjust strategies based on changing attitudes
- Track engagement effectiveness

## Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting indirect stakeholders** - People not directly involved but affected
2. **Static register** - Not updating as project evolves
3. **Assuming attitude** - Not verifying with actual conversations
4. **Over-communicating to all** - Same updates for everyone wastes time
5. **Ignoring resistant stakeholders** - They do not disappear, they escalate

## Next Steps

After creating your stakeholder register:
1. Share with project team for input
2. Begin engagement with high-priority stakeholders
3. Set up communication rhythms
4. Connect to M-PM-002 (RACI Matrix) for role clarity
