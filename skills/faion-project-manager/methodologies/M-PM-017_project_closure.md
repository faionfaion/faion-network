# M-PM-017: Project Closure

## Problem

Projects fade away without formal ending. Deliverables are not officially accepted. Resources stay allocated to "completed" work. Documentation is incomplete. Knowledge is lost. Vendors are not released. The project is never truly finished.

Without proper closure:
- Ambiguous completion status
- Resources trapped
- No knowledge transfer
- Open contracts and liabilities
- Missing documentation

---

## Framework

### Why Close Formally?

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Confirm completion** | Official acceptance of deliverables |
| **Release resources** | People can move to new work |
| **Close contracts** | Legal and financial closure |
| **Capture knowledge** | Lessons for future projects |
| **Celebrate success** | Team recognition and morale |

### Step 1: Verify Deliverable Acceptance

Confirm all deliverables are complete and accepted:

| Deliverable | Status | Accepted By | Date | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------------|------|-------|
| [Deliverable 1] | Complete | [Name] | [Date] | [Notes] |
| [Deliverable 2] | Complete | [Name] | [Date] | [Notes] |

**Acceptance criteria:**
- All requirements met
- Testing complete
- Documentation delivered
- Sign-off obtained

### Step 2: Complete Administrative Closure

**Financial closure:**
- Process final invoices
- Close purchase orders
- Return unused budget
- Final cost reconciliation

**Resource closure:**
- Release team members
- Return equipment
- Close access/permissions
- Update resource plans

**Contract closure:**
- Final vendor payments
- Warranty/support handover
- Contract termination letters
- Archive agreements

### Step 3: Conduct Lessons Learned

Before team disperses:

- Schedule lessons learned session
- Document what worked and what did not
- Store in organizational knowledge base
- See M-PM-015 (Lessons Learned)

### Step 4: Archive Project Documents

Organize and store:

| Category | Documents |
|----------|-----------|
| **Planning** | Charter, scope, WBS, schedule, budget |
| **Execution** | Status reports, meeting notes, change log |
| **Technical** | Specifications, designs, code, tests |
| **Contracts** | Agreements, SOWs, invoices |
| **Closure** | Acceptance forms, final report |

**Storage location:** [Define organizational standard]

### Step 5: Write Final Project Report

Document project completion:

```markdown
# Final Project Report: [Project Name]

## Executive Summary
[Project objectives, outcomes, key metrics]

## Deliverables
[List of what was delivered]

## Performance Summary
- Schedule: [On time / X days early/late]
- Budget: [On budget / $X under/over]
- Scope: [Complete / Changes made]
- Quality: [Metrics achieved]

## Key Accomplishments
[Major achievements]

## Challenges and Resolutions
[Problems encountered and solutions]

## Lessons Learned Summary
[Top lessons]

## Transition Information
[Handover details]

## Acknowledgments
[Team recognition]
```

### Step 6: Transition to Operations

Ensure smooth handover:

| Item | From | To | Date |
|------|------|-----|------|
| System access | Project team | Support team | [Date] |
| Documentation | PM | Knowledge base | [Date] |
| Support tickets | N/A | Help desk | [Date] |
| Monitoring | Project | Operations | [Date] |

### Step 7: Celebrate and Recognize

Do not skip this step:

- Thank team members
- Recognize contributions
- Celebrate achievements
- Mark the milestone

## Examples

### Example 1: Software Project Closure

**Project:** Customer Portal v2.0
**Duration:** 6 months
**Budget:** $150,000

**Closure activities:**
1. Final UAT sign-off obtained from business sponsor
2. Production deployment confirmed stable (2 weeks)
3. Support team trained and documentation handed over
4. Final cost: $147,500 (under budget)
5. Lessons learned captured (5 major learnings)
6. Team celebration lunch held
7. Final report distributed to stakeholders
8. Project marked closed in system

### Example 2: Early Closure (Cancelled Project)

**Project:** Mobile App Prototype
**Reason:** Strategic pivot, no longer aligned with business goals

**Closure activities:**
1. Documented work completed (30%)
2. Lessons learned on prototyping approach
3. Recovered reusable components (design assets)
4. Released resources to other projects
5. Closed vendor contract (negotiated early termination)
6. Archived all documentation
7. Final report with cancellation rationale

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **No formal acceptance** - Assuming silence means approved
2. **Resources not released** - People stuck on "finished" projects
3. **Contracts left open** - Ongoing costs, liabilities
4. **No lessons captured** - Knowledge walks out the door
5. **No celebration** - Team feels unappreciated

---

## Types of Project Closure

| Type | Situation | Actions |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Normal** | Project objectives met | Full closure process |
| **Early (Success)** | Objectives met ahead of schedule | Accelerated closure |
| **Early (Cancelled)** | Project stopped before completion | Document reasons, recover value |
| **Integration** | Project absorbed into operations | Transition-focused closure |

---

## Next Steps

After project closure:
1. Confirm with sponsor project is officially closed
2. Update portfolio/program status
3. Begin benefits tracking (post-implementation)
4. Apply lessons to next project
5. Connect to M-PM-018 (Stakeholder Engagement)
