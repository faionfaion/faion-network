# M-PM-026: Hybrid Delivery

## Problem

Pure agile or pure waterfall rarely fits real projects.

## Solution: Hybrid Approaches

**Core Principle:** "Plan with Waterfall, Execute with Agile"
- Waterfall for design, planning, requirements
- Agile for development, testing, iteration

**Hybrid Patterns:**

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Water-Scrum-Fall** | Fixed requirements, iterative development | Hardware + Software |
| **Agile with Gates** | Need stage approvals | Regulated industries |
| **Phased Agile** | Large programs, multiple teams | Enterprise rollouts |
| **Selective Agile** | Some components need agility | Backend stable, frontend dynamic |
| **DevOps + Agile** | Continuous delivery required | 2026 winning approach |

**Hybrid Use Cases:**
- Products with hardware + software components
- Backend + frontend technology separation
- Regulatory deliverables + creative work
- Enterprise systems with varied risk profiles

**Decision Framework:**
```
High uncertainty + Frequent change -> Agile
Clear requirements + Fixed scope -> Predictive
Mixed characteristics -> Hybrid
Continuous deployment needed -> Agile + DevOps
```

**Hybrid Best Practices:**
- Define which parts are agile vs predictive
- Establish integration points between approaches
- Maintain single source of truth
- Align ceremonies with governance
- Train team on both approaches
- Use appropriate tooling (not just Word/Excel/tickets)
- Involve Product Owners early and often
- Create detailed product backlog for long-term visibility
- Establish checkpoints for process assessment

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Dogma over fit (choosing method because it's trendy)
- Poorly defined hybrid boundaries
- Lack of stakeholder alignment
- Insufficient tooling
