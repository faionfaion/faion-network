# M-PMT-012: Reporting & Dashboards

## Overview

Effective reporting and dashboards transform raw project data into actionable insights. This methodology covers dashboard design principles, key metrics selection, automated reporting, and stakeholder-specific views across different PM tools.

## When to Use

- Setting up new project visibility systems
- Improving existing reporting capabilities
- Creating stakeholder-specific dashboards
- Automating status reporting
- Implementing portfolio-level visibility

## Process/Steps

### 1. Metrics Framework

**Metric Categories:**
```yaml
metrics:
  delivery_metrics:
    - velocity: "Story points completed per sprint"
    - throughput: "Issues completed per time period"
    - cycle_time: "Time from start to completion"
    - lead_time: "Time from request to delivery"
    - burndown: "Work remaining in sprint"
    - burnup: "Work completed over time"

  quality_metrics:
    - escaped_defects: "Bugs found in production"
    - defect_density: "Bugs per story point"
    - rework_rate: "Reopened issues percentage"
    - test_coverage: "Code coverage percentage"

  flow_metrics:
    - wip: "Work in progress count"
    - flow_efficiency: "Active time / total time"
    - cumulative_flow: "Status distribution over time"
    - aging_wip: "Time items spend in each state"

  team_metrics:
    - capacity_utilization: "Actual vs planned hours"
    - focus_factor: "Productive time ratio"
    - team_happiness: "Satisfaction score"
    - predictability: "Commitment vs delivery"
```

### 7. Dashboard Design Principles

**Information Hierarchy:**
```
Level 1: Overall Health (traffic light)
├── Level 2: Key Metrics (numbers)
│   ├── Level 3: Trend Charts (graphs)
│   │   └── Level 4: Detailed Data (tables)
```

**Color Coding:**
```yaml
status_colors:
  green: "On track, no issues"
  yellow: "At risk, needs attention"
  red: "Off track, requires escalation"
  blue: "Information, neutral"
  gray: "Not started, N/A"
```

**Widget Layout:**
```
+------------------+------------------+
|   Main Metric    |  Secondary       |
|   (Large)        |  Metric          |
+------------------+------------------+
|                                     |
|   Primary Chart                     |
|   (Wide, important trend)           |
|                                     |
+------------------+------------------+
| Quick Stats | Quick Stats | Quick   |
| (Small)     | (Small)     | Stats   |
+------------------+------------------+
|                                     |
|   Detailed Table (scrollable)       |
|                                     |
+-------------------------------------+
```

## Best Practices

### Dashboard Design
1. **Less is more** - Focus on actionable metrics
2. **Context matters** - Include targets and trends
3. **Update automatically** - Real-time when possible
4. **Mobile-friendly** - Accessible anywhere
5. **Consistent layout** - Familiar patterns

### Metric Selection
1. **Align with goals** - Measure what matters
2. **Balance lagging/leading** - Past and predictive
3. **Avoid vanity metrics** - Must drive decisions
4. **Limit to 5-7 key metrics** - Prevent overload

### Reporting
1. **Know your audience** - Tailor detail level
2. **Lead with insights** - Not just data
3. **Include actions** - What to do next
4. **Regular cadence** - Build trust through consistency

### Continuous Improvement
1. **Review effectiveness** - Are dashboards used?
2. **Gather feedback** - Ask stakeholders
3. **Iterate design** - Improve based on usage
4. **Archive old dashboards** - Keep system clean

## Templates/Examples

### Portfolio Dashboard Config

```yaml
portfolio_dashboard:
  title: "Engineering Portfolio"
  refresh: 15_minutes

  row_1:
    - widget: status_overview
      width: 4
      config:
        projects: all
        show: health_status

    - widget: delivery_confidence
      width: 4
      config:
        metric: on_time_percentage
        target: 90

    - widget: resource_utilization
      width: 4
      config:
        show: percentage

  row_2:
    - widget: burnup_chart
      width: 8
      config:
        scope: quarterly_roadmap
        show_scope_changes: true

    - widget: risk_summary
      width: 4
      config:
        show: top_5_risks
        sort_by: impact

  row_3:
    - widget: project_table
      width: 12
      columns:
        - name
        - status
        - progress
        - owner
        - due_date
        - risk_level
```

### Jira JQL Queries for Dashboards

```sql
-- Sprint Scope (current sprint)
project = PROJ AND sprint in openSprints()

-- Completed This Sprint
project = PROJ AND sprint in openSprints() AND status = Done

-- In Progress
project = PROJ AND status = "In Progress"

-- Blocked Items
project = PROJ AND labels = blocked AND status != Done

-- Bugs by Priority (pie chart)
project = PROJ AND type = Bug AND status != Done

-- Created vs Resolved (2D filter)
project = PROJ AND created >= -30d

-- Velocity Data (custom field)
project = PROJ AND sprint in closedSprints() AND status = Done
-- Group by sprint, sum story points

-- Aging Issues
project = PROJ AND status = "In Progress" AND updated < -7d

-- Release Scope
project = PROJ AND fixVersion = "1.0.0"
```

### PowerBI Connection

```python
# Connect PM tool to PowerBI
import requests
import pandas as pd

def fetch_jira_data(jql_query):
    """Fetch Jira data for PowerBI"""
    url = f"{JIRA_URL}/rest/api/3/search"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {JIRA_TOKEN}"}
    params = {
        "jql": jql_query,
        "fields": "summary,status,priority,customfield_10026",  # story points
        "maxResults": 1000
    }

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
    issues = response.json()["issues"]

    return pd.DataFrame([{
        "key": i["key"],
        "summary": i["fields"]["summary"],
        "status": i["fields"]["status"]["name"],
        "priority": i["fields"]["priority"]["name"],
        "story_points": i["fields"].get("customfield_10026", 0)
    } for i in issues])

# Example: Velocity trend
velocity_data = fetch_jira_data(
    "project = PROJ AND sprint in closedSprints() AND status = Done"
)
```
