# M-PM-021: PMBOK 8 Focus Areas

## Problem

Process Groups too rigid for modern delivery approaches.

## Solution: Five Focus Areas

Replaces Process Groups with flexible Focus Areas applicable to all delivery methods. Nearly 80% of practitioners supported reintroducing process groups as foundational concepts.

| Focus Area | Purpose | Predictive | Agile |
|------------|---------|------------|-------|
| **Initiating** | Establish vision, purpose, alignment | Project charter | Vision, goals |
| **Planning** | Define approach, build estimates, identify risks | WBS, requirements | Backlog, user stories |
| **Executing** | Perform work to achieve objectives | Work packages | Sprints, iterations |
| **Monitoring & Controlling** | Track performance, manage changes | EVM, baselines | Velocity, burndown |
| **Closing** | Formal completion, lessons learned | Final reports | Retrospectives |

**Focus Area Integration:**
```
Initiating <-> Planning <-> Executing
     ^                         |
     <- Monitoring & Controlling <-
              |
           Closing
```

**40 Non-Prescriptive Processes:**
- Distributed across 5 Focus Areas and 7 Performance Domains
- Describe how work is commonly performed
- Allow tailoring based on environment and project needs
- Updated, streamlined, and reorganized from PMBOK 6
