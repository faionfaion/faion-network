## Problem

Projects fail when key stakeholders are ignored or mismanaged. Without proper engagement, you face:
- Missed requirements from silent stakeholders
- Resistance from influential people
- Scope creep from unmanaged expectations
- Project delays from approval bottlenecks

## Framework

### Step 1: Identify All Stakeholders

Create a comprehensive list of everyone affected by or affecting the project.

**Stakeholder Categories:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Sponsors** | Executive paying for the project |
| **Users** | People who will use the deliverable |
| **Customers** | External clients or internal departments |
| **Team** | People working on the project |
| **Regulators** | Government, compliance, legal |
| **Suppliers** | Third-party vendors, contractors |
| **Influencers** | Industry experts, media, unions |

### Step 2: Analyze Stakeholder Power/Interest

Map each stakeholder on the Power/Interest Grid:

```
         HIGH POWER
              |
    Keep      |     Manage
  Satisfied   |     Closely
              |
  --------------------------------
              |
    Monitor   |     Keep
    (Min)     |    Informed
              |
         LOW POWER
    LOW INTEREST     HIGH INTEREST
```

**Analysis Questions:**
1. What is their level of authority over the project?
2. How much do they care about the outcomes?
3. What are their expectations and concerns?
4. How can they help or hinder the project?

### Step 3: Plan Engagement Strategies

For each stakeholder quadrant:

| Quadrant | Strategy | Actions |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Manage Closely** | High touch, frequent | Weekly meetings, direct updates |
| **Keep Satisfied** | Show respect, quick response | Monthly briefings, escalation path |
| **Keep Informed** | Regular updates | Newsletters, status reports |
| **Monitor** | Minimal effort | General announcements |

### Step 4: Execute Communication Plan

**Communication Matrix Template:**

| Stakeholder | Method | Frequency | Owner | Content |
|-------------|--------|-----------|-------|---------|
| CEO | Email + Meeting | Monthly | PM | Executive summary |
| Users | Slack channel | Daily | Team Lead | Progress, blockers |
| Legal | Document review | Per milestone | BA | Compliance checks |

### Step 5: Monitor and Adapt

Engagement is continuous. Track:
- Stakeholder sentiment changes
- New stakeholders joining
- Power/interest shifts
- Communication effectiveness

## Common Mistakes

1. **Ignoring "quiet" stakeholders** - They often have hidden power
2. **One-size-fits-all communication** - Different stakeholders need different approaches
3. **Static analysis** - Power/interest changes over time
4. **Forgetting end users** - They determine actual project success
5. **Underestimating resistors** - They can derail projects
