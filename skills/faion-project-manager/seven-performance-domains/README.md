# Seven Performance Domains

## Project Management Framework 8 Updated Domains

| Domain | Key Activities | Notable Changes |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Governance** | Oversight, decision frameworks, value realization | Replaces Integration Management |
| **Scope** | Define/control what's included/excluded | Enhanced definition |
| **Schedule** | Plan/manage timelines and dependencies | Same focus |
| **Finance** | Budgets, costs, financial performance | Replaces Cost Management |
| **Stakeholders** | Identify, analyze, engage all stakeholders | Now includes Communications |
| **Resources** | Acquire/manage team, physical resources | Enhanced focus |
| **Risk** | Identify, analyze, respond to uncertainties | Same focus |

**Integrated Areas (No Longer Standalone):**
- Quality -> Integrated throughout all domains
- Communications -> Part of Stakeholders domain
- Procurement -> Appendix + integrated throughout

**New Emphasis:**
- **Value Delivery** over output delivery
- **Systems Thinking** - understand project in broader organizational context
- **Sustainability** - environmental, social, and economic impact
- **Governance Integration** - stronger portfolio/program/project links
