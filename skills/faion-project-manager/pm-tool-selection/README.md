# PM Tool Selection

## Overview

Selecting the right project management tool is crucial for team productivity and project success. This methodology provides a structured evaluation framework considering features, team needs, scalability, and total cost of ownership.

## When to Use

- Starting a new team/project without existing tooling
- Outgrowing current PM solution
- Consolidating multiple tools across organization
- Evaluating tools during vendor renewal
- Post-merger tool standardization

## Process/Steps

### 1. Requirements Gathering

**Stakeholder Interview Template:**
```yaml
interview_questions:
  current_state:
    - "What tools do you currently use for project management?"
    - "What works well with your current setup?"
    - "What are your biggest pain points?"
    - "How much time do you spend on PM tool administration?"

  workflow_needs:
    - "Describe your typical project lifecycle"
    - "What approval processes do you have?"
    - "How do you track progress and report status?"
    - "What integrations are essential?"

  team_context:
    - "How many people will use the tool?"
    - "What are their technical skill levels?"
    - "Do you have remote/distributed teams?"
    - "What time zones do teams operate in?"

  future_needs:
    - "How do you expect to grow in the next 2 years?"
    - "What new processes might you adopt?"
    - "Are there compliance requirements coming?"
    - "What's your budget flexibility?"
```

## Best Practices

### Requirements Phase
1. **Involve all stakeholders** - Don't just ask engineering
2. **Prioritize requirements** - MoSCoW method works well
3. **Consider future needs** - Tool should grow with you
4. **Document constraints** - Budget, compliance, timeline

### Evaluation Phase
1. **Real-world testing** - Use actual project data
2. **Time-box POC** - 2 weeks is usually enough
3. **Multiple evaluators** - Different perspectives matter
4. **Standardized criteria** - Compare apples to apples

### Decision Phase
1. **Weighted scoring** - Prioritize what matters
2. **Reference checks** - Talk to other customers
3. **Negotiate pricing** - Always ask for discounts
4. **Plan for migration** - Factor into timeline

### Post-Selection
1. **Document decision** - ADR for future reference
2. **Plan rollout** - Phased approach recommended
3. **Set success metrics** - How will you measure?
4. **Review periodically** - Tools evolve, needs change

## Templates/Examples

### Tool Evaluation ADR

```markdown
# ADR-005: PM Tool Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our current tool (Jira) is causing productivity issues due to complexity
and performance. Team of 30 engineers needs a modern, fast alternative.

## Decision
We will migrate to Linear as our primary project management tool.

## Evaluation Summary
| Tool | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Linear | 8.5/10 | Best UX, fast, good GitHub integration |
| ClickUp | 7.5/10 | Feature-rich but complex |
| GitHub Projects | 7.8/10 | Good but limited PM features |
| Notion | 7.0/10 | Better for docs than PM |

## Key Factors
1. **Speed**: Linear is significantly faster than Jira
2. **UX**: Keyboard-first design matches developer workflow
3. **GitHub**: Excellent integration with our code workflow
4. **Price**: Similar to Jira at our scale

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved daily productivity
- Better developer experience
- Faster issue tracking

### Negative
- Migration effort required
- Some advanced Jira features unavailable
- Learning curve for team

## Migration Plan
- Phase 1: Pilot with Platform team (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Migrate remaining teams (4 weeks)
- Phase 3: Jira sunset (2 weeks)

## Review Date
6 months post-migration
```
