## M-PM-021: PMBOK 8 Focus Areas

### Problem

Process Groups too rigid for modern delivery approaches.

### Solution: Five Focus Areas

Replaces Process Groups with flexible Focus Areas applicable to all delivery methods. Nearly 80% of practitioners supported reintroducing process groups as foundational concepts.

| Focus Area | Purpose | Predictive | Agile |
|------------|---------|------------|-------|
| **Initiating** | Establish vision, purpose, alignment | Project charter | Vision, goals |
| **Planning** | Define approach, build estimates, identify risks | WBS, requirements | Backlog, user stories |
| **Executing** | Perform work to achieve objectives | Work packages | Sprints, iterations |
| **Monitoring & Controlling** | Track performance, manage changes | EVM, baselines | Velocity, burndown |
| **Closing** | Formal completion, lessons learned | Final reports | Retrospectives |

**Focus Area Integration:**
```
Initiating ←→ Planning ←→ Executing
     ↑                         ↓
     ← Monitoring & Controlling ←
              ↓
           Closing
```

**40 Non-Prescriptive Processes:**
- Distributed across 5 Focus Areas and 7 Performance Domains
- Describe how work is commonly performed
- Allow tailoring based on environment and project needs
- Updated, streamlined, and reorganized from PMBOK 6

## M-PM-022: Seven Performance Domains

### PMBOK 8 Updated Domains

| Domain | Key Activities | Notable Changes |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Governance** | Oversight, decision frameworks, value realization | Replaces Integration Management |
| **Scope** | Define/control what's included/excluded | Enhanced definition |
| **Schedule** | Plan/manage timelines and dependencies | Same focus |
| **Finance** | Budgets, costs, financial performance | Replaces Cost Management |
| **Stakeholders** | Identify, analyze, engage all stakeholders | Now includes Communications |
| **Resources** | Acquire/manage team, physical resources | Enhanced focus |
| **Risk** | Identify, analyze, respond to uncertainties | Same focus |

**Integrated Areas (No Longer Standalone):**
- Quality → Integrated throughout all domains
- Communications → Part of Stakeholders domain
- Procurement → Appendix + integrated throughout

**New Emphasis:**
- **Value Delivery** over output delivery
- **Systems Thinking** - understand project in broader organizational context
- **Sustainability** - environmental, social, and economic impact
- **Governance Integration** - stronger portfolio/program/project links

## M-PM-023: Six Core Principles

### Guiding Principles (PMBOK 8)

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Adopt Holistic View** | See project as part of larger system |
| **Focus on Value** | Deliver outcomes, not just outputs |
| **Embed Quality** | Quality built in, not tested in |
| **Lead Accountably** | Ethical, transparent leadership |
| **Integrate Sustainability** | Consider environmental, social impact |
| **Build Empowered Teams** | Trust, autonomy, collaboration |

**Application:**
```
Decision Framework:
1. Does this deliver value?
2. Does this consider the whole system?
3. Is quality embedded?
4. Am I being accountable?
5. Is it sustainable?
6. Does it empower the team?
```

## M-PM-024: AI in Project Management

### PMBOK 8 AI Appendix

First dedicated coverage of AI in PMBOK. Addresses ethical technology use, AI-assisted decisions, and sustainable project delivery.

**AI Applications:**

| Area | AI Application | Adoption Rate (2024) |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Risk Management** | Predictive risk identification, probability forecasting | 54% |
| **Task Automation** | Routine task handling, workflow automation | 53% |
| **Predictive Analysis** | Outcome forecasting, trend detection | 52% |
| **Schedule Optimization** | Timeline prediction, dependency analysis | 52% |
| **Resource Planning** | Capacity forecasting, skill matching | 47% |

**The AI Productivity Paradox (DORA 2025):**
- AI coding assistants boost individual output (21% more tasks, 98% more PRs)
- But organizational delivery metrics stay flat
- Bottlenecks shift to review, integration, and deployment
- Need end-to-end visibility via Value Stream Management

**Implementation Approach:**
```
1. Start with low-risk, high-value AI use cases
2. Maintain human oversight for decisions
3. Validate AI recommendations
4. Document AI-assisted decisions
5. Build team AI literacy
6. Monitor for shifted bottlenecks
```

**Industry Results:**
- 96% prediction accuracy (Intelligent Project Prediction tool)
- 15% reduction in budget overruns (Acciona)
- 84% improved efficiency (Project.co survey)

## M-PM-026: Hybrid Delivery

### Problem

Pure agile or pure waterfall rarely fits real projects.

### Solution: Hybrid Approaches

**Core Principle:** "Plan with Waterfall, Execute with Agile"
- Waterfall for design, planning, requirements
- Agile for development, testing, iteration

**Hybrid Patterns:**

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Water-Scrum-Fall** | Fixed requirements, iterative development | Hardware + Software |
| **Agile with Gates** | Need stage approvals | Regulated industries |
| **Phased Agile** | Large programs, multiple teams | Enterprise rollouts |
| **Selective Agile** | Some components need agility | Backend stable, frontend dynamic |
| **DevOps + Agile** | Continuous delivery required | 2026 winning approach |

**Hybrid Use Cases:**
- Products with hardware + software components
- Backend + frontend technology separation
- Regulatory deliverables + creative work
- Enterprise systems with varied risk profiles

**Decision Framework:**
```
High uncertainty + Frequent change → Agile
Clear requirements + Fixed scope → Predictive
Mixed characteristics → Hybrid
Continuous deployment needed → Agile + DevOps
```

**Hybrid Best Practices:**
- Define which parts are agile vs predictive
- Establish integration points between approaches
- Maintain single source of truth
- Align ceremonies with governance
- Train team on both approaches
- Use appropriate tooling (not just Word/Excel/tickets)
- Involve Product Owners early and often
- Create detailed product backlog for long-term visibility
- Establish checkpoints for process assessment

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Dogma over fit (choosing method because it's trendy)
- Poorly defined hybrid boundaries
- Lack of stakeholder alignment
- Insufficient tooling

## M-PM-028: Value Stream Management

### Problem

AI productivity gains evaporate when lacking end-to-end visibility. Teams optimize locally while constraints shift.

### Solution: VSM + Flow Metrics + DORA

**Value Stream Mapping (VSM):**
- Originated from lean management
- Popularized by Mik Kersten's "Project to Product" (2018)
- Identifies bottlenecks outside software team

**Key VSM Metrics:**

| Metric | Definition | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Lead Time** | Time from accept work to handoff | End-to-end flow |
| **Process Time** | Time if uninterrupted | Efficiency |
| **%C/A** | % received without rework needed | Quality |
| **Cycle Time** | Time within a process | Process efficiency |
| **Throughput** | Items completed per time period | Delivery rate |

### DORA Metrics

| Metric | Description | Level Indicator |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Deployment Frequency** | How often code deploys to production | Elite: multiple/day |
| **Change Lead Time** | Commit to production time | Elite: <1 hour |
| **Change Failure Rate** | % deployments causing failure | Elite: <5% |
| **Mean Time to Recovery** | Time to restore service | Elite: <1 hour |
| **Reliability** | Service availability | New metric |

### Combining DORA + Flow Metrics

**DORA:** Development → Release (DevOps efficiency)
**Flow Metrics:** Customer request → Release → Customer (business value)

**Best Practice:**
- Use DORA for DevOps maturity
- Use Flow Metrics for holistic value delivery
- ValueOps Insights: alignment score from both

**VSM Implementation:**
```
1. Map current value stream (request → delivery)
2. Identify bottlenecks with metrics
3. Measure DORA for DevOps stages
4. Apply Flow Metrics end-to-end
5. Optimize flow, not just individual stages
6. Monitor AI productivity paradox
```

| **Resource Optimization** | Multi-variable allocation | Maximize utilization |
| **Risk Detection** | Pattern recognition in project data | Proactive mitigation |
| **Material Pricing** | Price volatility forecasting | Informed purchasing |

### Implementation Considerations

**Common Barriers:**
- Messy data
- Disconnected systems
- Limited analytics skills
- Integration with legacy systems
- Resistance to change

**Human Element:**
- AI handles routine analysis and alerts
- PMs focus on strategy, relationships, leadership
- Build systems that complement human expertise
