## M-PM-021: PMBOK 8 Focus Areas

| **Guiding** | Set direction, governance | Project charter | Vision, goals |
| **Defining** | Define scope, approach | WBS, requirements | Backlog, user stories |
| **Executing** | Deliver value | Work packages | Sprints, iterations |
| **Measuring** | Track performance | EVM, baselines | Velocity, burndown |
| **Improving** | Continuous improvement | Lessons learned | Retrospectives |

**Focus Area Integration:**
```
Guiding ←→ Defining ←→ Executing
    ↑                      ↓
    ← Measuring ← Improving ←
