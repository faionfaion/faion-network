## Problem

Meta's Threads launched as a Twitter/X alternative and crossed 100M+ users in days. The platform is still maturing, but early adopters have a massive opportunity. Algorithm favors engagement and conversation. Less competition than Twitter.

Most people fail because they either ignore Threads entirely or simply cross-post from Twitter without adapting. The platform has different dynamics and rewards authentic, conversational content.

---

## Framework

Threads growth leverages your Instagram following while building a new audience:

```
INSTAGRAM SYNC  -> Import followers automatically
CONVERSATION    -> Reply, engage, discuss
CONSISTENCY     -> Post multiple times daily
PERSONALITY     -> Be authentic and conversational
TRENDS          -> Jump on platform-specific trends
```

### Step 1: Account Setup

**Profile optimization:**

| Element | Best Practice | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Username** | Same as Instagram | Auto-synced |
| **Display name** | Searchable, with keyword | Can differ from IG |
| **Bio** | Short, punchy, clear | 160 characters max |
| **Link** | One URL | Update based on goals |
| **Profile photo** | Same as Instagram | Synced automatically |

**Bio formula:**
```
[What you do] → [Who you help] → [CTA or personality]

Examples:
- Building SaaS tools → Helping devs ship faster → Let's chat
- Founder of @product → Sharing the journey → DM me anything
- Marketing for startups → 0 → 1 growth tips → Follow for daily insights
```

**Instagram integration:**
- Profile pulls from Instagram
- Option to auto-share to Instagram
- Followers can easily switch
- Cross-promotion built-in

### Step 2: Content Strategy

**What works on Threads:**

| Content Type | Performance | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Hot takes** | High | Unpopular opinions about your industry |
| **Questions** | Very High | "What's the one tool you can't live without?" |
| **Personal stories** | High | Quick anecdotes, lessons learned |
| **Quick tips** | Medium-High | Actionable advice in 1-2 sentences |
| **Engagement bait** | Very High | "Only respond with one word..." |
| **Threads (multiple posts)** | High | Multi-part stories or tips |

**Content types to avoid:**
- Overly promotional posts
- Long-form content (save for Twitter/blogs)
- Cross-posts that don't fit platform
- Content without engagement hooks

**Content pillars:**

| Pillar | Description | Frequency |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Opinions** | Takes on industry topics | 2-3/day |
| **Value** | Tips, insights, learnings | 1-2/day |
| **Questions** | Engagement drivers | 1/day |
| **Personal** | Behind the scenes, stories | 1/day |
| **Curated** | Interesting finds, quotes | 1/day |

### Step 3: Posting Strategy

**Optimal cadence:**

| Metric | Minimum | Optimal |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Posts/day** | 3 | 7-10 |
| **Replies/day** | 20 | 50+ |
| **Engagement time** | 15 min | 45+ min |

**Best times to post:**
- Morning: 8-10 AM (early engagement)
- Lunch: 12-2 PM (break scrolling)
- Evening: 6-9 PM (prime time)
- Test for YOUR audience

**Posting tips:**
- No scheduling yet (use manual posting)
- Spread posts throughout day
- Reply within first hour for algorithm boost
- Quote other posts to add commentary

### Step 4: Engagement Strategy

**Reply strategy (key to growth):**

1. Turn on notifications for large accounts
2. Be first to reply with value
3. Add insight, not just agreement
4. Ask follow-up questions
5. Be genuinely helpful

**Reply formula:**
```
[Agree/Disagree] + [Add your perspective] + [Question or invitation]

Bad: "Great point!"
Good: "This is so true. I found the same thing when building [X]. What made you realize this?"
```

**Thread replies (multi-post responses):**
- Start a conversation on your own post
- Reply to yourself to extend thoughts
- Creates more engagement surface area
- Algorithm sees it as active conversation

### Step 5: Building Conversations

**Conversation starters:**

| Type | Template | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **This or That** | "[A] or [B]?" | "Notion or Obsidian?" |
| **Hot take** | "Unpopular opinion: [take]" | "Unpopular opinion: MVPs are overrated" |
| **Fill in blank** | "The best [X] is ___" | "The best VSCode extension is ___" |
| **Experience** | "Raise your hand if you've ever [X]" | "Raise your hand if you've ever shipped on Friday" |
| **Prediction** | "In 2025, [prediction]" | "In 2025, AI will replace [X]" |

**Building genuine connections:**
- Reply thoughtfully to others
- Remember previous conversations
- Share others' good content
- Be generous with credit
- Collaborate publicly

### Step 6: Cross-Platform Strategy

**Threads + Instagram synergy:**

```
Instagram Reels → Drive discovery
        ↓
    Profile visit
        ↓
    Thread follow (linked in bio)
        ↓
    Threads engagement → Deeper connection
        ↓
    Back to Instagram → Full-circle
```

**Cross-posting guidelines:**

| From | To Threads | Adaptation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Twitter/X | Yes with edits | Soften tone, more conversational |
| Instagram captions | Sometimes | Shorten, add question |
| LinkedIn | Rarely | Too formal usually |
| Blog posts | Extract quotes | One key insight per post |

**What NOT to cross-post:**
- Highly promotional content
- Platform-specific content (TikTok trends)
- Long threads (break into multiple posts)
- Content with platform-specific features

### Step 7: Convert to Business

**Threads funnel:**

```
Posts → Engagement → Profile visit → Link click
                          ↓
                    Instagram follow → Deeper relationship
```

**Conversion tactics:**
- Link in bio (one clear CTA)
- Mention your product naturally in stories
- Share genuine wins/updates
- Reply to relevant questions with your solution
- Don't be pushy (platform is anti-promotional)

**Lead generation:**
- DM conversations (manual, no automation yet)
- Profile link to landing page
- Mention newsletter/resource naturally
- Cross-promote from Instagram Stories
