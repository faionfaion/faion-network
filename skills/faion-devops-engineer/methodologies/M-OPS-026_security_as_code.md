## M-OPS-026: Security as Code (Policy as Code)

### Problem

Manual security policies don't scale; compliance gaps in dynamic environments.

### Solution: Policy as Code (PaC)

**Why PaC:**
- 96% of technical decision-makers say PaC is vital for secure, scalable cloud
- DevSecOps 2026 trends: shift-smart security, AI automation, supply chain hardening

**Core Tools:**

**Open Policy Agent (OPA):**
- CNCF-hosted general-purpose policy engine
- Enforces fine-grained, context-aware policies across entire stack
- Language: Rego (declarative, powerful, learning curve)
- Use cases: Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines
- Can enforce policies on any JSON/YAML input

**OPA Gatekeeper:**
- Kubernetes-native admission webhook
- Extends OPA specifically for Kubernetes governance
- Uses Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) + Rego policies
- Dual focus: prevention (admission control) + detection (audit)

**Kyverno:**
- Kubernetes-native policy engine
- YAML-based policies (no Rego learning curve)
- Better for teams wanting simpler Kubernetes-specific policies

**Tool Comparison:**
| Feature | OPA Gatekeeper | Kyverno |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Language | Rego | YAML |
| Scope | Multi-system (K8s, Terraform, etc.) | Kubernetes only |
| Learning curve | Steeper | Easier |
| Use case | Complex/custom logic needed | Simple K8s policies |

**Top Open-Source DevSecOps Tools 2026:**
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| OPA | Policy-as-Code engine |
| Sigstore | Artifact signing |
| Trivy | Vulnerability scanning |

**Best Practices:**
- Write security rules on Terraform plans AND Kubernetes API requests
- Use Gatekeeper audit to identify violations in existing resources
- Version control all policies in Git
- Integrate PaC into CI/CD pipelines
