## M-OPS-021: Platform Engineering

### Problem

Developers spend 40%+ time on infrastructure instead of features.

### Solution: Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)

**Key Components:**
- Self-service infrastructure provisioning
- Golden paths for common patterns
- Service catalog with templates
- Automated environment setup
- AI agents as first-class platform citizens (2026)
- Pre-deployment cost gates (FinOps integration)

**Benefits:**
- Environment setup: days -> minutes
- DevOps ticket volume: -40%
- Cognitive load reduction: 40-50%

**Tools:**
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Backstage | Service catalog, developer portal (CNCF) |
| Port | IDP with scorecard |
| Humanitec | Platform orchestration |
| Crossplane | Kubernetes-native IaC |
| Kratix | Framework for platform teams |
| Cortex | Service catalog + scorecards |

**Measurement Dimensions (2026):**
- Flow time (sustained focus periods)
- Friction points (cognitive/systemic blockers)
- Throughput patterns (commit -> deployment efficiency)
- Capacity allocation (feature work vs maintenance)

**AI Integration (2026):**
- AI agents with RBAC permissions and resource quotas
- Governance policies for AI workloads
- Predictive FinOps controls baked into development lifecycle

**Stats:**
- By 2026: 80% of large software engineering organizations will have platform teams (Gartner)
- By 2027: 80% of large enterprises leverage platform engineering to scale DevOps in hybrid cloud
