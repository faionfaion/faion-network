# AIOps

## Problem

Alert fatigue and slow incident response.

## Solution: AI-Powered Operations

**Capabilities:**
| Area | AI Application |
|------|----------------|
| Anomaly detection | Pattern recognition, subtle deviation detection |
| Root cause analysis | Correlation of events across systems |
| Predictive alerts | Forecast failures before production impact |
| Auto-remediation | Self-healing: restarts, scaling, rollbacks |
| Capacity planning | Demand forecasting, resource bottleneck prevention |

**2026 Evolution:**
- AI predicts failures and detects configuration deviations
- Automates fixes BEFORE incidents reach production
- Hybrid workflows: AI recommends → humans approve → systems execute
- Every step logged and explainable (audit trail)

**Tools 2026:**
| Tool | Key Capability |
|------|----------------|
| Splunk ITSI | ML on logs/metrics, prioritize incidents, predict outages |
| ServiceNow | Predictive AIOps, pre-built remediation actions |
| Dynatrace Davis AI | Real-time infrastructure monitoring, instant anomaly surfacing |
| Moogsoft | Noise reduction, ML-powered anomaly detection |
| BigPanda | AI-powered incident management, situational awareness |
| Site24x7 | Advanced anomaly detection, metric behavior monitoring |
| Coralogix | AI log monitoring, security vulnerability detection |

**Auto-Remediation Patterns:**
- Failing node → automatic restart
- Resource pressure → automatic scaling
- Bad deployment → automatic rollback to stable state
- Memory leak prediction → proactive mitigation

**Implementation Roadmap:**
| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Phase 1 | Prometheus + Fluent Bit, Isolation Forest anomaly detection |
| Phase 2 | AWS Lambda/Jenkins jobs for automated restarts/rollbacks |
| Phase 3 | Human-in-the-loop approvals via Slack/Teams |
| Phase 4 | Automated postmortems, feed lessons back to AI models |

**Stats:**
- 60%+ large enterprises moving to self-healing systems by 2026 (Gartner)
- 73% of enterprises implementing or planning AIOps by end of 2026
- SRE teams adopting hybrid AI workflows throughout 2026

**Integration Pattern:**
```
Metrics/Logs → AI Analysis → Alert Enrichment → Runbook Automation → Human Review (optional)
```
