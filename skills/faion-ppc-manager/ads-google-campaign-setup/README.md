## Problem

Google Ads can reach billions of people at the moment they're searching for your solution. But the platform is complex. Wrong settings burn through budget fast. Many advertisers never get past the learning phase.

This methodology covers the foundational setup to launch successful Google Ads campaigns.

---

## Framework

Google Ads has several campaign types:

```
SEARCH     -> Show ads when people search keywords
DISPLAY    -> Show image ads across websites
VIDEO      -> YouTube ads
SHOPPING   -> Product listings (e-commerce)
PMAX       -> AI-driven cross-channel
```

### Step 1: Set Up Conversion Tracking

**Before spending money:**

1. Create Google Ads account
2. Link to Google Analytics 4
3. Set up conversion actions
4. Install Google Tag (gtag.js)

**Conversion types:**

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| Website purchase | E-commerce sales |
| Lead form submit | Lead generation |
| Sign up | SaaS trials |
| Phone call | Local businesses |
| App install | Mobile apps |

**Conversion setup:**
```
1. Tools & Settings → Conversions
2. Create new conversion
3. Select category (Purchase, Lead, etc.)
4. Set value (fixed or dynamic)
5. Set attribution window (30-day click)
6. Install tracking code
```

### Step 2: Choose Campaign Type

**Campaign type selection:**

| Goal | Campaign Type | When to Use |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| High intent leads | Search | People actively searching |
| Brand awareness | Display | Reach and frequency |
| Retargeting | Display | Re-engage visitors |
| Product sales | Shopping | E-commerce with feed |
| Video views | Video | YouTube content |
| Maximum reach | Performance Max | Trust AI, broad goals |

**For beginners: Start with Search.** It's most direct and easiest to optimize.

### Step 3: Campaign Settings

**Campaign setup:**

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Campaign name | [Product]_[Type]_[Goal]_[Date] |
| Networks | Search Network only (uncheck Display) |
| Locations | Target your market specifically |
| Languages | Match your content |
| Bidding | Start with Maximize Conversions |
| Budget | $20-50/day minimum |

**Bidding strategies:**

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Maximize Conversions | Starting out, need data |
| Target CPA | Have historical data, know CPA |
| Target ROAS | E-commerce, know value |
| Manual CPC | Full control, experienced |

### Step 4: Ad Group Structure

**Campaign structure:**
```
Campaign: [Product] Search
├── Ad Group 1: [Theme A]
│   ├── Keywords (10-20 related)
│   ├── Ad 1
│   └── Ad 2
├── Ad Group 2: [Theme B]
│   ├── Keywords (10-20 related)
│   ├── Ad 1
│   └── Ad 2
└── Ad Group 3: [Theme C]
```

**Ad group best practices:**
- One theme per ad group
- 10-20 keywords per group
- Keywords should share intent
- Ads match keyword theme

### Step 5: Create Search Ads

**Responsive Search Ads (RSA):**
- Up to 15 headlines
- Up to 4 descriptions
- Google tests combinations

**Headlines (30 chars each):**
- Include main keyword
- Highlight benefits
- Add social proof
- Include numbers
- Use CTAs

**Descriptions (90 chars each):**
- Expand on benefits
- Include differentiators
- Add urgency/offers
- Clear call to action

**Example RSA:**
```
Headlines:
H1: [Keyword] for Startups
H2: Trusted by 10,000+ Teams
H3: Start Free Trial Today
H4: Easy Setup in 5 Minutes
H5: Save 30% This Month

    Join 10,000+ companies already using [Product].
D2: Automate your workflow and save 10+ hours per week.

```

### Step 6: Add Extensions

**Required extensions:**

| Extension | Purpose | Setup |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Sitelinks | More links to click | 4-6 relevant pages |
| Callouts | Highlight benefits | "Free Trial" "24/7 Support" |
| Structured snippets | Feature categories | Types, features |
| Image | Visual element | Logo, product images |
| Call | Phone number | If phone leads valuable |

**Extension tips:**
