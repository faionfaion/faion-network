| Scrum Phase | BA Activities |
|-------------|---------------|
| Sprint 0 | Vision, roadmap, initial backlog creation |
| Backlog Refinement | User story elaboration, acceptance criteria, models |
| Sprint Planning | Story clarification, dependency identification |
| Sprint Execution | Ad-hoc clarification, prototype review |
| Sprint Review | Solution validation, feedback capture |
| Retrospective | BA process improvement |

### BA in scaled agile frameworks Levels

| scaled agile frameworks Level | BA Role Mapping | Key Activities |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Team Level | Product Owner | User stories, acceptance criteria, backlog management |
| Program Level | Senior BA / System Architect | Domain modeling, feature analysis, dependency analysis |
