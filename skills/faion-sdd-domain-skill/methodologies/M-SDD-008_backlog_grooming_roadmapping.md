## Problem

Projects lose direction when:
- Feature requests pile up without prioritization
- No clear vision of where the product is going
- Teams work on low-impact items while important features wait
- Stakeholders don't know what's coming when

**The root cause:** No systematic backlog management and roadmap planning.

## Framework

### Backlog vs Roadmap

| Aspect | Backlog | Roadmap |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Question** | What could we build? | What will we build when? |
| **Time horizon** | All potential work | Next 3-12 months |
| **Detail level** | Requirements | Themes/milestones |
| **Audience** | Development team | Stakeholders, users |
| **Updates** | Weekly | Monthly/Quarterly |

### Backlog Structure

```
backlog/
├── ideas/          # Raw ideas, not yet validated
├── validated/      # Validated, ready for spec
├── specified/      # Has spec, ready for design
├── designed/       # Has design, ready for implementation
└── ready/          # Implementation-ready with tasks
```

### Backlog Item Lifecycle

```
IDEA → VALIDATE → SPECIFY → DESIGN → READY → IN PROGRESS → DONE
  ↓        ↓         ↓         ↓        ↓
 DROP    DROP     DROP      DROP    DEFER
```

### Grooming Process

#### Weekly Grooming (30-60 min)

1. **Review new ideas** (10 min)
   - Quick assessment: Is this worth exploring?
   - Move to validated or drop

2. **Prioritize backlog** (20 min)
   - Review top 20 items
   - Re-score based on new information
   - Adjust order

3. **Refine upcoming items** (20 min)
   - Add detail to next sprint's items
   - Clarify acceptance criteria
   - Identify dependencies

4. **Cleanup** (10 min)
   - Archive old items
   - Remove duplicates
   - Update estimates

### Prioritization Frameworks

#### RICE Scoring

| Factor | Question | Score |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **R**each | How many users affected? | 1-10 |
| **I**mpact | How much impact per user? | 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 |
| **C**onfidence | How confident in estimates? | 50%, 80%, 100% |
| **E**ffort | Person-months to complete | 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6+ |

**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

#### MoSCoW

| Category | Meaning | Rule |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Must** | Critical for release | ~60% of scope |
| **Should** | Important but not critical | ~20% of scope |
| **Could** | Nice to have | ~20% of scope |
| **Won't** | Explicitly not in this release | Document for future |

#### Value vs Effort Matrix

```
HIGH VALUE
    │
    │  Quick Wins    │    Big Bets
    │  (Do first)    │    (Plan carefully)
    │────────────────┼────────────────
    │  Fill-ins      │    Money Pits
    │  (Do if time)  │    (Avoid)
    │
    └─────────────────────────────────→ HIGH EFFORT
```

### Roadmap Structure

#### Time-Based Roadmap

```
Q1 2026              Q2 2026              Q3 2026

```

#### Theme-Based Roadmap

## Examples

### Example: RICE Scoring

**Feature:** Add social login (Google, GitHub)

| Factor | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Reach | 8 | 80% of users would use it |
| Impact | 1 | Medium impact (convenience) |
| Confidence | 80% | Good data from competitors |
| Effort | 1 | ~1 person-month |

**RICE Score = (8 × 1 × 0.8) / 1 = 6.4**

**Feature:** Add dark mode

| Factor | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Reach | 3 | 30% of users requested |
| Impact | 0.5 | Low impact (cosmetic) |
| Confidence | 100% | Clear requirement |
| Effort | 0.5 | ~2 weeks |

**RICE Score = (3 × 0.5 × 1.0) / 0.5 = 3.0**

**Decision:** Social login (6.4) > Dark mode (3.0). Do social login first.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too many P0s | Only 1-3 items can be "most important" |
| Roadmap as commitment | Roadmap is plan, not promise - update as you learn |
| Never dropping items | Regularly archive old, irrelevant items |
| Grooming as status meeting | Focus on prioritization, not updates |
| No "Won't do" list | Explicitly document what you're NOT doing |
