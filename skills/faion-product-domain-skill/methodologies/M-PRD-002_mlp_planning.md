## Problem

MVP validates ideas but often fails to retain users. Common issues:
- Users try MVP, get value, but leave for better UX
- "Minimum" becomes "mediocre"
- No clear path from validation to retention
- Competing on features instead of experience

**The root cause:** No framework for evolving from viable to lovable.

---

## Framework

### What is MLP?

Minimum Lovable Product is the smallest version that:
1. Delivers core value (like MVP)
2. Creates emotional connection
3. Gives users a reason to stay AND recommend

**Key insight:** MLP = MVP + delight. Not more features, better experience.

### MVP vs MLP Comparison

| Aspect | MVP | MLP |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Goal | Validate | Retain |
| Focus | Functionality | Experience |
| Quality | Good enough | Polished |
| Emotion | "It works" | "I love it" |
| Word of mouth | Unlikely | Likely |

### The MLP Framework

#### Layer 1: Functional (MVP baseline)

**Must satisfy:**
- Core job gets done
- No blocking bugs
- Acceptable performance

#### Layer 2: Reliable

**Adds:**
- Consistent experience
- Error handling
- Edge cases covered
- Works as expected

#### Layer 3: Usable

**Adds:**
- Easy to learn
- Efficient to use
- Minimal friction
- Good defaults

#### Layer 4: Delightful (MLP target)

**Adds:**
- Emotional satisfaction
- Surprising moments
- Premium feel
- Shareable moments

### MLP Planning Process

#### Step 1: Audit Your MVP

**For each core feature, rate 1-5:**

| Feature | Functional | Reliable | Usable | Delightful |
|---------|------------|----------|--------|------------|
| [Feature 1] | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| [Feature 2] | ? | ? | ? | ? |

**MLP threshold:** All features at 4+ on all layers.

#### Step 2: Identify Delight Opportunities

**Where can you add delight:**
- First impression (onboarding)
- Core action (the main thing they do)
- Success moments (when they win)
- Recovery moments (when things go wrong)

**Delight categories:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Speed | Faster than expected | Instant search results |
| Simplicity | Easier than expected | One-click checkout |
| Personality | Unexpected charm | Clever copywriting |
| Anticipation | Knows what they need | Smart defaults |
| Celebration | Acknowledges success | Confetti on completion |

#### Step 3: Prioritize Polish

**Polish priority = User pain × Frequency × Visibility**

| Task | Pain (1-5) | Frequency | Visibility | Priority |
|------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| [Task] | ? | ? | ? | ? |

**Focus on:** High frequency, high visibility interactions.

#### Step 4: Define MLP Criteria

**Template:**
```
For [user segment]
MLP means [specific outcomes]:
1. [Functional criteria]
2. [Reliable criteria]
3. [Usable criteria]
4. [Delightful criteria]

Measured by: [How to verify]
```

#### Step 5: Plan the Gap

**Gap analysis:**

| Feature | Current State | MLP Target | Gap | Effort |
|---------|---------------|------------|-----|--------|
| [Feature] | [Description] | [Target] | [What's missing] | [Days] |

### Polish Backlog

| Task | Layer | Effort | Impact | Priority |
|------|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| [Task 1] | Usable | 1 day | High | P1 |
| [Task 2] | Delight | 2 days | Medium | P2 |

|--------|--------------|------------|
| Day 7 retention | [X]% | [Y]% |
| Day 30 retention | [X]% | [Y]% |
| NPS | [X] | [Y] |
| Core action completion | [X]% | [Y]% |
