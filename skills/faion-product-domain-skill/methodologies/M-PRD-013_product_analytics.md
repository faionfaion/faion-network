## Problem

Teams collect data but don't know what to do with it. Issues:
- Tracking everything, understanding nothing
- No connection between metrics and decisions
- Dashboards nobody looks at
- Analysis paralysis

**The root cause:** No framework for connecting analytics to product decisions.

## Framework

### What is Product Analytics?

Product analytics is measuring and analyzing user behavior to make better product decisions. It answers: "What are users doing and why?"

### Analytics Maturity Levels

| Level | Focus | Capabilities |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 1. Basic | What happened | Page views, signups |
| 2. Intermediate | Who did what | User segmentation |
| 3. Advanced | Why and what if | Funnels, cohorts |
| 4. Predictive | What will happen | ML, forecasting |

**Start at Level 2 minimum.**

### Key Metric Categories

#### Acquisition
- Visitors, signups, sources
- Conversion rates
- Cost per acquisition

#### Activation
- Onboarding completion
- Time to value
- First key action

#### Engagement
- DAU/WAU/MAU
- Session frequency
- Feature usage

#### Retention
- D1, D7, D30 retention
- Cohort retention curves
- Churn rate

#### Revenue
- MRR, ARPU, LTV
- Upgrade/downgrade rates
- Revenue per cohort

### Analytics Implementation Process

#### Step 1: Define Key Questions

**Before implementing, answer:**
- What decisions will this data inform?
- What behavior are we trying to understand?
- What's the minimum we need to track?

**Bad:** "Track everything"
**Good:** "Track if users complete onboarding"

#### Step 2: Create Tracking Plan

**For each event:**
- Event name (standardized)
- When it fires
- Properties captured
- Owner

**Naming convention:**
```
[Object] [Action]
Example: Account Created, Feature Used, Upgrade Started
```

#### Step 3: Implement Tracking

**Best practices:**
- Server-side for critical events
- Client-side for UX insights
- Consistent user identification
- Property standardization

#### Step 4: Build Dashboards

**Dashboard types:**

| Dashboard | Purpose | Audience |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Exec summary | High-level health | Leadership |
| Product health | Core metrics | Product team |
| Feature deep-dive | Specific feature | Feature owner |
| Experiment | Test results | Product/Growth |

#### Step 5: Establish Rituals

- **Daily:** Glance at key metrics
- **Weekly:** Review dashboard, note anomalies
- **Monthly:** Deep dive analysis
- **Quarterly:** Goal vs actual, planning

## Analysis: [Topic]

### Question
[What we're trying to understand]

### Methodology

- Time period: [Dates]
- Segments: [How split]
- Sample size: [N]

### Findings

#### Key Insight 1: [Title]
[Chart or table]
**Observation:** [What we see]
**Implication:** [What it means]

#### Key Insight 2: [Title]
...

### Recommendations
1. [Action based on findings]

## Examples

### Example 1: Onboarding Analysis

**Question:** Why is activation low?

**Findings:**
- 60% start onboarding
- 40% complete step 1
- 15% complete step 3 (big drop)
- 10% fully activate

**Insight:** Step 3 (connect data source) has 62% dropoff.

**Root cause:** Integration takes too long, users give up.

**Action:** Add sample data option to skip integration.

### Example 2: Feature Usage Analysis

**Question:** Which features drive retention?

**Findings:**
| Feature | Usage | 30-day Retention |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| Dashboard | 90% | 45% |
| Reports | 30% | 75% |
| Integrations | 20% | 80% |

**Insight:** Low-usage features correlate with high retention.

**Action:** Promote Reports and Integrations in onboarding.
