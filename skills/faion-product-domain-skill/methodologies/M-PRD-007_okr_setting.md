## Problem

Goal-setting is either too vague or too rigid. Common issues:
- Goals like "improve the product" (unmeasurable)
- Too many objectives (no focus)
- Key results that are really tasks
- OKRs set and forgotten

**The root cause:** No structured framework connecting ambition to measurable progress.

---

## Framework

### What are OKRs?

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) is a goal-setting framework that combines:
- **Objectives:** Qualitative, inspiring goals
- **Key Results:** Quantitative measures of success

### OKR Structure

```
OBJECTIVE: [What we want to achieve - inspiring, qualitative]
│
├── KR1: [Measure 1 - specific, measurable, time-bound]
├── KR2: [Measure 2]
└── KR3: [Measure 3]
```

**Rule:** 3-5 Objectives, each with 3-5 Key Results.

### Objective Characteristics

**Good Objectives are:**

| Characteristic | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| Inspiring | Motivates the team | "Delight our users" |
| Qualitative | Not a number | "Build world-class onboarding" |
| Time-bound | Clear period | "This quarter" |
| Ambitious | Stretch goal | "Industry-leading retention" |
| Memorable | Easy to recall | Short, punchy |

**Bad Objectives:**
- "Increase signups by 20%" (that's a KR)
- "Launch feature X" (that's a task)
- "Improve stuff" (too vague)

### Key Result Characteristics

**Good KRs are:**

| Characteristic | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| Measurable | Clear number | "Reduce churn from 5% to 3%" |
| Specific | No ambiguity | "NPS score of 50+" |
| Time-bound | Deadline | "By end of Q2" |
| Outcome-focused | Not output | "Activation rate 60%" not "ship 5 features" |
| Challenging | 70% confidence | Stretch but achievable |

**Scoring:**
- 0.0-0.3 = Failed
- 0.4-0.6 = Progress made
- 0.7-1.0 = Success (0.7 is ideal target)

### OKR Setting Process

#### Step 1: Align to Strategy

**Inputs:**
- Company mission/vision
- Annual goals
- Previous period learnings
- Market conditions

**Question:** What must we accomplish this quarter to move toward our vision?

#### Step 2: Draft Objectives

**Brainstorm:**
1. What's most important right now?
2. If we could only achieve one thing, what would it be?
3. What would make this quarter a success?

**Limit:** 3-5 objectives maximum.

#### Step 3: Define Key Results

**For each Objective:**
1. How will we know we achieved it?
2. What metrics matter?
3. What's the target number?

**Test:** Can you answer with just a number at EOQ?

#### Step 4: Validate

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Objectives are inspiring and qualitative
- [ ] KRs are measurable outcomes (not tasks)
- [ ] 70% confidence on achieving KRs
- [ ] Connected to higher-level goals
- [ ] Not too many (focus!)

#### Step 5: Communicate & Commit

- Share with stakeholders
- Get buy-in
- Make visible (dashboard, wiki)

#### Step 6: Track & Adjust

- Weekly check-ins
- Monthly scoring
- EOQ retrospective
