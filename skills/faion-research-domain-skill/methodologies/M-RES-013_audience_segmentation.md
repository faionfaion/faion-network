## Problem

"Everyone is my customer" leads to weak positioning and wasted marketing spend. Issues:
- Messaging too generic to resonate
- Features built for nobody in particular
- Marketing scattered across channels
- Pricing that fits nobody well

**The root cause:** No segmentation strategy to identify and prioritize target groups.

## Framework

### What is Audience Segmentation?

Audience segmentation is dividing your potential market into distinct groups that have different needs, behaviors, or characteristics. It answers: "Which specific groups should we focus on?"

### Segmentation Criteria

#### 1. Demographic Segmentation

| Variable | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Age | 18-24, 25-34, 35-44 |
| Income | <$50K, $50-100K, $100K+ |
| Education | High school, Bachelor's, Masters+ |
| Occupation | Developer, marketer, founder |
| Company size | Solo, 1-10, 11-50, 51-200 |
| Industry | SaaS, E-commerce, Consulting |

**Best for:** B2B targeting, pricing tiers

#### 2. Behavioral Segmentation

| Variable | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Usage frequency | Daily, weekly, monthly |
| Purchase history | Free, paid, churned |
| Feature usage | Core only, power user |
| Engagement | Active, passive, dormant |
| Buying stage | Aware, considering, ready |

**Best for:** Product development, retention strategies

#### 3. Psychographic Segmentation

| Variable | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Values | Quality over price, innovation |
| Attitudes | Risk-tolerant, skeptical |
| Lifestyle | Work-life balance, hustle culture |
| Motivations | Status, security, creativity |
| Pain tolerance | "Just make it work" vs perfectionists |

**Best for:** Messaging, brand positioning

#### 4. Needs-Based Segmentation

| Variable | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Problem severity | Critical, moderate, nice-to-have |
| Current solution | DIY, competitor, nothing |
| Budget | Limited, flexible, money is no object |
| Speed priority | Need it yesterday, can wait |
| Support needs | Self-serve, guided, white-glove |

**Best for:** Product tiers, pricing strategy

### Segmentation Process

#### Step 1: Gather Data

**Sources:**

| Source | What to Extract |
|--------|-----------------|
| Customer interviews | Qualitative patterns |
| CRM data | Demographics, behavior |
| Analytics | Usage patterns |
| Survey responses | Preferences, attitudes |
| Sales conversations | Objections, needs |

#### Step 2: Identify Dimensions

Choose 2-3 most meaningful variables:

```
Dimension 1: [Most important differentiator]
Dimension 2: [Second most important]
(Optional) Dimension 3: [Third most important]
```

**Example:**
- Dimension 1: Company size (Solo, Small, Medium)
- Dimension 2: Tech sophistication (Low, Medium, High)

#### Step 3: Create Segments

**2×2 Matrix (simplest):**

```
                    Dimension 1
                Low           High
           |              |
Dimension  | Segment A    | Segment B
2  High    |              |
           |--------------|-------------
           | Segment C    | Segment D
   Low     |              |
```

**Example for project management tool:**

```
                    Company Size
                Solo          Team (5-20)
           |              |
Tech       | "The         | "The Scale-Up"
Savvy High | Hacker"      | Needs: Collaboration
           |--------------|-------------
           | "The         | "The Traditional"
   Low     | Overwhelmed" | Needs: Simple + Training
```

#### Step 4: Evaluate Segments

**Segment attractiveness criteria:**

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Size | 20% | How many people? |
| Growth | 15% | Is it growing? |
| Reachability | 20% | Can we access them? |
| Profitability | 20% | Will they pay enough? |
| Fit | 15% | Do we understand them? |
| Competition | 10% | How crowded? |

**Score each segment 1-5, calculate weighted total.**

#### Step 5: Select Target Segments

**Prioritization strategies:**

| Strategy | Description | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Concentrated | Focus on one segment | Limited resources |
| Differentiated | Target 2-3 with different approaches | More resources |
| Niche | Deep focus on sub-segment | Crowded market |

**For solopreneurs:** Start with ONE segment until $10K+ MRR.
