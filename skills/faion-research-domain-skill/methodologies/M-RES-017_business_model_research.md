## Problem

Entrepreneurs build products without viable business models. Common issues:
- "We'll figure out monetization later"
- Wrong revenue model for the product type
- Unsustainable unit economics
- Misaligned with customer expectations

**The root cause:** No systematic analysis of how value translates to revenue.

## Framework

### What is Business Model Research?

Business model research is analyzing how a business will create, deliver, and capture value. It answers: "How will this make money sustainably?"

### The Business Model Canvas

Nine building blocks:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Key Partners │ Key Activities │ Value        │ Customer    │ Customer │
│              │                │ Proposition  │ Relationships│ Segments │
│              │ Key Resources  │              │              │          │
│              │                │              │ Channels     │          │
├──────────────┴────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────┤
│     Cost Structure                    │    Revenue Streams            │
└───────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
```

### Revenue Model Options

#### 1. Subscription/SaaS

**How it works:** Recurring payment for ongoing access

| Software license | Perpetual license | Sketch |
| Physical product | Goods | E-commerce |

**Best for:** Discrete value, impulse buys

**Key metrics:** Units sold, revenue per product, repeat purchase

#### 3. Transaction-Based

**How it works:** Fee per transaction

| Variant | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Percentage | % of transaction | Stripe 2.9% |
| Flat fee | Fixed per transaction | PayPal |
| Hybrid | Base + percentage | Shopify |

**Best for:** Marketplaces, payments, brokerage

**Key metrics:** GMV, take rate, transaction volume

#### 4. Advertising

| Service marketplace | Service providers | Upwork |
| Product marketplace | Product sellers | Etsy |
| Lead generation | Qualified leads | Thumbtack |

**Best for:** Matching problems, network effects

**Key metrics:** GMV, take rate, liquidity

### Business Model Analysis Process

#### Step 1: Map Value Chain

```
[Suppliers] → [Your Product] → [Customers]
      ↑                              ↓
   [Partners]                   [End Users]
```

**Questions:**
- Where is value created?
- Who captures the value?
- What's your role in the chain?

#### Step 2: Identify Revenue Opportunities

For each value point:
- Who benefits?
- What would they pay?
- How would they pay?
- How often?

#### Step 3: Analyze Comparable Models

Research similar products:
- What models do they use?
- What's their pricing?
- What's working/not working?
- What's their churn/growth?

#### Step 4: Calculate Unit Economics

**Key calculations:**

```
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):
= Total marketing & sales spend / New customers acquired

Lifetime Value (LTV):
= ARPU × Gross margin × (1 / Churn rate)

LTV:CAC Ratio:
= LTV / CAC (target: 3:1 or higher)

Payback Period:
= CAC / (ARPU × Gross margin) (target: <12 months)
```

#### Step 5: Stress Test

| Test | Question |
|------|----------|
| Scale | Does this work at 10x, 100x? |
| Competition | What if prices drop 50%? |
| Churn | What if churn doubles? |
| CAC | What if acquisition costs rise? |
| Time | How long until profitable? |

### Unit Economics Calculator

```markdown
## Unit Economics: [Product]

### Revenue Metrics
- **ARPU (Monthly):** $[X]
- **ARPU (Annual):** $[X]
- **Gross margin:** [X]%

### Acquisition Metrics
- **Marketing spend:** $[X]/month
- **Sales spend:** $[X]/month
- **New customers:** [X]/month
- **CAC:** $[X]

### Retention Metrics
- **Monthly churn:** [X]%
- **Average lifetime:** [X] months

### Calculations

**LTV:**
= $[ARPU] × [Gross margin] × (1 / [Churn rate])
= $[X]

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**
= $[LTV] / $[CAC]
= [X]:1 ([Good/Bad] - target 3:1+)

**Payback Period:**
= $[CAC] / ($[ARPU] × [Gross margin])
= [X] months ([Good/Bad] - target <12)

### Break-even Analysis
- Fixed costs: $[X]/month
- Contribution margin: $[X]/customer
- Break-even point: [X] customers

### Verdict
[ ] Unit economics work
[ ] Need to improve [metric]
[ ] Model not viable
