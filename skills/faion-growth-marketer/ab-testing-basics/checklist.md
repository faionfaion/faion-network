# Checklist - A/B Testing Basics

## Preparation

- [ ] Identify the metric you want to improve (conversion, retention, engagement)
- [ ] Determine statistical significance level (typically 95%)
- [ ] Calculate required sample size
- [ ] Set test duration (typically 1-2 weeks minimum)
- [ ] Identify experiment platform (Google Optimize, VWO, Optimizely)
- [ ] Brief team on test hypothesis

## Test Setup

- [ ] Define control version (current state)
- [ ] Define variant version (proposed change)
- [ ] Set traffic allocation (typically 50/50 split)
- [ ] Configure success metric tracking
- [ ] Set baseline metric value
- [ ] Create sample size calculator spreadsheet

## Running the Test

- [ ] Launch test with adequate traffic
- [ ] Monitor daily results (don't peek too often)
- [ ] Check for data collection issues
- [ ] Verify tracking is working correctly
- [ ] Watch for external factors affecting results
- [ ] Document any unusual patterns

## Analysis & Results

- [ ] Calculate statistical significance (p-value < 0.05)
- [ ] Compare control vs variant metrics
- [ ] Determine confidence level (typically 95%+)
- [ ] Calculate lift (% improvement)
- [ ] Analyze secondary metrics
- [ ] Check for statistical artifacts

## Decision & Implementation

- [ ] Make win/lose decision
- [ ] If win: Deploy variant to 100% of users
- [ ] If inconclusive: Extend test duration
- [ ] If lose: Document learnings
- [ ] Implement winner or revert to control
- [ ] Update metrics dashboard

## Documentation & Next Steps

- [ ] Document hypothesis, result, and lift
- [ ] Add to experiment log
- [ ] Share results with stakeholders
- [ ] Identify next test to run
- [ ] Update product roadmap if needed
- [ ] Plan follow-up test
