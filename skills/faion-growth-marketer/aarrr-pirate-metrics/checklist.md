# Checklist - AARRR Pirate Metrics

## Preparation

- [ ] Define Acquisition metric (CPA, sign-up rate, channel mix)
- [ ] Define Activation metric (must correlate with D30 retention)
- [ ] Identify Retention KPIs (D1, D7, D30)
- [ ] Determine Revenue model (MRR/ARPU/LTV)
- [ ] Choose Referral target (K-factor or NPS)
- [ ] Set up analytics tools (GA, Mixpanel, Amplitude)

## Stage 1: Acquisition

- [ ] Track all acquisition channels (organic, paid, social, referral, direct, email)
- [ ] Calculate CPA for each channel
- [ ] Monitor sign-up rate (benchmark: 2-5%)
- [ ] Segment users by channel
- [ ] Set monthly acquisition target

## Stage 2: Activation

- [ ] Define activation event (key user action)
- [ ] Verify activation correlates with D30 retention
- [ ] Set activation rate target (benchmark: 30-50%)
- [ ] Measure time to first value (benchmark: <10 min)
- [ ] Track onboarding completion (benchmark: 60-80%)
- [ ] Identify activation bottleneck

## Stage 3: Retention

- [ ] Calculate D1 retention (benchmark: 40-60%)
- [ ] Calculate D7 retention (benchmark: 20-30%)
- [ ] Calculate D30 retention (benchmark: 10-15%)
- [ ] Measure monthly churn rate (benchmark: <5%)
- [ ] Analyze retention by cohort
- [ ] Identify when users drop off

## Stage 4: Revenue

- [ ] Determine monetization model
- [ ] Calculate MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- [ ] Calculate ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
- [ ] Calculate LTV (Lifetime Value)
- [ ] Track free-to-paid conversion (for freemium)
- [ ] Segment revenue by customer type

## Stage 5: Referral

- [ ] Calculate K-factor (invites × conversion rate)
- [ ] Track referral rate (benchmark: 5-15%)
- [ ] Measure NPS (benchmark: >50)
- [ ] Identify natural sharing moments
- [ ] Test referral incentives
- [ ] Monitor referral quality (are they good users?)

## Dashboarding & Analysis

- [ ] Create weekly AARRR dashboard
- [ ] Set targets for each stage
- [ ] Identify worst-performing stage
- [ ] Document current metrics baseline
- [ ] Schedule weekly team reviews

## Optimization Planning

- [ ] Prioritize improvements to worst stage
- [ ] Design experiments for each stage
- [ ] Define success criteria for experiments
- [ ] Run A/B tests
- [ ] Measure impact on AARRR metrics

## Reporting

- [ ] Document weekly metrics
- [ ] Compare against targets
- [ ] Highlight trends and anomalies
- [ ] Share learnings with team
- [ ] Update documentation
