# Checklist - Growth via Viral Mechanics

## Viral Strategy Definition

- [ ] Identify viral opportunity in product
- [ ] Define target K-factor (must be > 1.0 for compounding)
- [ ] Determine viral cycle time
- [ ] Calculate required conversion rates at each step
- [ ] Set realistic viral growth projections
- [ ] Document viral strategy

## Viral Hook Design

- [ ] Find most natural sharing moment
- [ ] Design frictionless sharing mechanism
- [ ] Create viral coefficient optimization plan
- [ ] Decide on incentive (if needed)
- [ ] Design referral landing page
- [ ] Test with early users

## K-Factor Optimization

- [ ] Calculate current K-factor
- [ ] Identify bottleneck (invites or conversions)
- [ ] Design experiments to improve weakest metric
- [ ] A/B test invitation messaging
- [ ] Test landing page variations
- [ ] Measure impact on K-factor

## Referral Quality

- [ ] Track retention of referred users
- [ ] Compare referred vs organic user retention
- [ ] Segment retention by referral source
- [ ] Identify quality issues
- [ ] Improve onboarding for referred users
- [ ] Verify viral loop sustainability

## Multi-Channel Virality

- [ ] Integrate sharing to email
- [ ] Add sharing to calendar/contacts
- [ ] Enable social sharing (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)
- [ ] Create SMS referral option
- [ ] Build referral through existing apps
- [ ] Measure channel-specific K-factors

## Viral Growth Tracking

- [ ] Create viral growth dashboard
- [ ] Track K-factor daily
- [ ] Monitor viral coefficient by segment
- [ ] Measure viral loop cycle time
- [ ] Project exponential growth curve
- [ ] Alert on viral threshold breaches

## Paid Loop Integration

- [ ] Calculate viral loop CAC
- [ ] Determine CAC payback period
- [ ] Compare viral vs paid CAC
- [ ] Build paid loop for underperforming channels
- [ ] Optimize paid spend based on viral potential
- [ ] Plan growth loop stack (viral + paid)

## Scaling & Evolution

- [ ] Increase viral loop visibility
- [ ] Add additional viral moments
- [ ] Expand sharing channels
- [ ] Optimize for mobile sharing
- [ ] Build community features
- [ ] Plan secondary viral loops
