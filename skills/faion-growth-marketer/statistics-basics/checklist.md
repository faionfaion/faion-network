# Checklist - Statistics for Growth Marketing

## Understand Statistical Concepts

- [ ] Learn normal distribution concept
- [ ] Understand sample size importance
- [ ] Learn statistical significance (p-value)
- [ ] Understand confidence intervals
- [ ] Learn type 1 and type 2 errors
- [ ] Understand statistical power

## Sample Size Calculation

- [ ] Define baseline conversion rate
- [ ] Set minimum detectable effect (MDE)
- [ ] Choose confidence level (typically 95%)
- [ ] Set statistical power (typically 80%)
- [ ] Calculate required sample size
- [ ] Determine test duration

## Hypothesis Testing

- [ ] Formulate null hypothesis
- [ ] Formulate alternative hypothesis
- [ ] Set significance level (alpha = 0.05)
- [ ] Calculate p-value from test results
- [ ] Compare p-value to significance level
- [ ] Make decision (reject or fail to reject null)

## Conversion Rate Testing

- [ ] Calculate baseline conversion rate
- [ ] Set improvement target
- [ ] Run A/B test for appropriate duration
- [ ] Calculate control and variant conversion rates
- [ ] Calculate lift percentage
- [ ] Determine statistical significance

## Confidence Intervals

- [ ] Calculate confidence interval for control
- [ ] Calculate confidence interval for variant
- [ ] Interpret confidence interval width
- [ ] Use confidence intervals for decisions
- [ ] Understand margin of error
- [ ] Account for confidence intervals in planning

## Correlation vs Causation

- [ ] Understand correlation definition
- [ ] Learn correlation coefficient (r)
- [ ] Understand causation requires experiments
- [ ] Avoid confounding variables
- [ ] Design controlled experiments
- [ ] Document causal assumptions

## Common Mistakes

- [ ] Avoid peeking at results too early
- [ ] Don't stop test at arbitrary point
- [ ] Avoid multiple comparisons bias
- [ ] Don't confuse correlation with causation
- [ ] Avoid selection bias
- [ ] Document all testing procedures

## Tools & Resources

- [ ] Use statistical calculator
- [ ] Learn A/B testing tool capabilities
- [ ] Understand analytics platform statistics
- [ ] Use statistical software (R, Python, etc.)
- [ ] Read statistical references
- [ ] Join statistics learning community
