## Problem

You acquire users, but they use your product once and never return. Acquisition costs keep rising while lifetime value stays flat. You are filling a leaky bucket.

Retention loops create self-reinforcing cycles that keep users coming back. Instead of constantly re-engaging users externally, the product itself drives habitual return.

---

## Framework

### What is a Retention Loop?

A retention loop is a self-reinforcing cycle where using the product creates reasons to return.

```
        USER TAKES ACTION
               ↓
        VALUE IS CREATED
               ↓
        USER IS REWARDED
               ↓
        TRIGGER TO RETURN
               ↓
        USER RETURNS
               ↓
        (cycle repeats)
```

### Retention vs One-Time Value

```
ONE-TIME VALUE                 RETENTION LOOP
─────────────────────          ─────────────────────
User needs something           User needs something
    ↓                              ↓
Uses product                   Uses product
    ↓                              ↓
Gets value                     Gets value
    ↓                              ↓
Done (leaves)                  Creates reason to return
                                   ↓
                               Returns (loop continues)
```

### Types of Retention Loops

| Type | Driver | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Content | New content to consume | Netflix, TikTok |
| Social | Activity from connections | Facebook, Slack |
| Progress | Accumulating value | Duolingo streaks |
| Stored Value | Data/content created | Notion, Evernote |
| Habit | Triggered routine | Morning news app |
| Network | Others depend on you | Team tools |

## The Hook Model

Based on Nir Eyal's "Hooked" framework:

```
1. TRIGGER
   External or internal cue
        ↓
2. ACTION
   Simple behavior
        ↓
3. VARIABLE REWARD
   Satisfying but unpredictable
        ↓
4. INVESTMENT
   User puts something in
        ↓
   (creates next trigger)
```

### Component 1: Trigger

**External triggers:**
- Push notification
- Email
- SMS
- Calendar reminder
- Social media mention

**Internal triggers:**
- Boredom → open TikTok
- Loneliness → open Instagram
- Uncertainty → Google it
- FOMO → check feed

**Goal:** Move from external to internal triggers

### Component 2: Action

The simplest behavior in anticipation of reward.

| Product | Trigger | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Instagram | Notification | Open app, check feed |
| Duolingo | Morning alarm | Open app, start lesson |
| Email | Badge count | Open, read messages |
| Slack | Red dot | Check channel |

**Design principle:** Reduce friction maximally

```
High friction: Open app → navigate → search → action
Low friction:  Open app → action (feed is right there)
```

### Component 3: Variable Reward

Unpredictability makes rewards compelling.

**Types of variable rewards:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Tribe | Social validation | Likes, comments, follows |
| Hunt | Search for resources | Scrolling for content |
| Self | Personal achievement | Completing level, mastery |

**Why variable?**

Predictable: "You get 10 points" → boring quickly
Variable: "You might get 10-1000 points" → keeps engaging

### Component 4: Investment

User contribution that increases future value.

| Investment | How It Helps Retention |
|------------|------------------------|
| Data entry | More personalized experience |
| Following/connecting | More relevant content |
| Content creation | Invested in platform |
| Reputation | Social capital to lose |
| Customization | Switching cost |
| Learning curve | Mastery investment |

---

## Building Retention Loops

### Step 1: Identify Your Loop Type

**Question:** What brings users back naturally?

| Product Type | Primary Loop |
|--------------|--------------|
| Content platform | New content from creators/algorithm |
| Social network | Activity from friends |
| Productivity tool | Work to complete, team activity |
| Marketplace | New listings, transactions |
| Gaming | Progress, social, new content |
| Utility | Recurring need (tax software) |

### Step 2: Design the Core Loop

**Template:**

```
When user [TRIGGER],
they [ACTION] to get [REWARD],
which causes them to [INVEST],
creating the next [TRIGGER].
```

**Example - Duolingo:**

```
When user sees daily reminder (TRIGGER),
they complete a lesson (ACTION) to maintain streak (REWARD),
which increases their skill level (INVEST),
making tomorrow's reminder more compelling (next TRIGGER).
```

### Step 3: Add Reinforcement Mechanisms

**Streaks:**
```
Day 1: 🔥 1 day streak
Day 7: 🔥🔥 7 day streak - Reward unlocked!
Day 30: 🔥🔥🔥 30 day streak - Achievement badge!

Break streak: "Don't lose your 30-day streak!
             Use streak freeze ($5) to protect it"
```

**Progress bars:**
```
Profile completeness: ████████░░ 80%
"Add a photo to reach 100%"
```

**Social proof:**
```
"Sarah just completed 5 tasks"
"Your team shipped 12 features this week"
"You're in the top 10% of users this month"
```

### Step 4: Create Triggers

**Trigger timing strategy:**

| Trigger Type | When to Use | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Time-based | Predictable usage | 9 AM daily digest |
| Event-based | Something happened | "John commented on your post" |
| Behavior-based | User pattern | "You usually check in at 3 PM" |
| Inactivity-based | User at risk | "We miss you! Here's what's new" |

**Trigger hierarchy:**

```
Best:  Internal trigger (user thinks of you naturally)
Good:  Event trigger (real activity to show)
OK:    Time trigger (routine-based)
Weak:  Generic reminder (no context)
```
