## Problem

Search behavior is fundamentally changing. AI agents don't just search - they complete tasks, make decisions, and select providers autonomously. Traditional SEO strategies won't work when AI assistants handle 50%+ of searches.

---

## Framework

### What is Agentic Commerce

AI agents autonomously:
- Complete entire purchase flows
- Compare options across providers
- Make recommendations based on trust signals
- Execute transactions without human intervention

```
Traditional: User → Search → Click → Browse → Buy
Agentic:     User → AI Agent → [AI handles entire flow] → Confirm
```

### How AI Agents Evaluate Businesses

| Factor | Weight | What AI Looks For |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Earned media | High | Coverage in reputable publications |
| Review quality | High | Authentic reviews with high scores |
| Entity authority | High | Clear expertise signals |
| Cross-platform consistency | Medium | Same info everywhere |
| Structured data | Medium | Schema, knowledge graphs |
| API availability | Medium | Machine-readable interfaces |

**Key Difference from SEO:**
- SEO: Optimize for keywords and backlinks
- GEO: Optimize for trust and authority (harder to game)

---

## Implementation

### 1. Build Real Authority

**Earned Media Strategy:**
- Get featured in industry publications
- Publish original research
- Contribute expert commentary
- Build relationships with journalists

**Review Management:**
- Collect authentic reviews across platforms
- Respond professionally to all feedback
- Display reviews prominently
- Monitor review sentiment

**Expertise Signals:**
- Author bios on all content
- E-E-A-T optimization
- Published case studies
- Industry certifications

### 2. Optimize for Task Completion

**Identify User Tasks:**

| Industry | Task Examples |
|----------|---------------|
| E-commerce | "Find best laptop for video editing under $1500" |
| B2B SaaS | "Find CRM for 50-person sales team" |
| Local Services | "Book plumber for emergency leak" |
| Professional Services | "Find tax accountant for LLC" |

**Position as Solution:**
- Use task-oriented content

### 3. Cross-Platform Consistency

**Ensure Consistent NAP:**
- Name, Address, Phone identical everywhere
- Google Business Profile
- Social media profiles

**Entity Clarity:**
```
Bad:  Different company descriptions on each platform
Good: Identical core information, same logo, consistent messaging
```

### 4. Multi-Format Content

AI pulls from diverse sources:

| Format | Platform | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Text | Website, blogs | Core information |
| Video | YouTube, TikTok | Demonstrations |
| Audio | Podcasts | Thought leadership |
| Structured | Schema, APIs | Machine-readable |
