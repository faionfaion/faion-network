# Checklist - Viral Loop Optimization

## Baseline & Measurement

- [ ] Calculate current K-factor
- [ ] Measure invite rate (% of users)
- [ ] Calculate invites per user (average)
- [ ] Measure referral conversion rate
- [ ] Track viral cycle time
- [ ] Document baseline metrics

## Analyze Bottlenecks

- [ ] Identify if bottleneck is invites or conversions
- [ ] Measure awareness of referral feature
- [ ] Test friction in sharing process
- [ ] Analyze referral message quality
- [ ] Measure landing page conversion
- [ ] Identify pre-signup friction

## Increase Invite Rate

- [ ] Make invite button more visible
- [ ] Add referral moment at key touchpoints
- [ ] Implement passive viral (auto-generate shareable content)
- [ ] Gamify invitations (rewards, leaderboards)
- [ ] Personalize invitation messaging
- [ ] Test reminder to invite

## Improve Referral Quality

- [ ] Optimize referral landing page
- [ ] Pre-fill invitation message
- [ ] Add social proof/trust signals
- [ ] Simplify signup flow for referred users
- [ ] Create contextualized onboarding
- [ ] Measure conversion by message quality

## Optimize Incentives

- [ ] Test inviter-only incentives
- [ ] Test dual-sided incentives
- [ ] Vary incentive amounts (A/B test)
- [ ] Test different reward types (free features, credits)
- [ ] Implement tiered rewards
- [ ] Track impact on quality of referred users

## Virality Testing Plan

- [ ] Design hypothesis for each test
- [ ] Set minimum effect size to detect
- [ ] Run A/B test on invite messaging
- [ ] Test placement variations
- [ ] Test incentive variations
- [ ] Test referral landing page variations

## Multi-Touch Virality

- [ ] Add viral hook to sign-up flow
- [ ] Add viral hook to aha moment
- [ ] Add viral hook to power user workflow
- [ ] Integrate with email/calendar/social
- [ ] Create multiple sharing opportunities
- [ ] Measure total referral contribution

## Monitoring & Iteration

- [ ] Track K-factor daily
- [ ] Alert if K-factor drops
- [ ] Measure impact of changes
- [ ] Analyze results by segment
- [ ] Iterate on winner variations
- [ ] Plan next optimization cycle
