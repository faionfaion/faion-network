# Checklist - Viral Loops

## Identify Viral Moments

- [ ] Map all user workflows
- [ ] Find natural sharing/invitation moments
- [ ] Identify friction in sharing process
- [ ] Brainstorm viral hooks
- [ ] Interview users about sharing behavior
- [ ] Analyze existing referral data

## Measure Current Virality

- [ ] Calculate current K-factor (invites × conversion)
- [ ] Measure invite rate (% users who invite)
- [ ] Track invitation-to-signup conversion
- [ ] Analyze viral loop cycle time
- [ ] Segment virality by user type
- [ ] Document baseline metrics

## Design Viral Hook

- [ ] Find most natural sharing moment in product
- [ ] Design frictionless sharing (pre-filled message)
- [ ] Create shareable content (link, preview)
- [ ] Add social proof (see who used it)
- [ ] Make sharing easy (one-click buttons)
- [ ] Personalize invitation message

## Incentive Structure

- [ ] Decide on incentive (free feature, credit, etc.)
- [ ] Test incentive for inviter only
- [ ] Test incentive for both inviter and invitee
- [ ] Design tiered rewards (more invites = bigger reward)
- [ ] Measure impact of incentive on virality
- [ ] Optimize incentive over time

## Implementation

- [ ] Add share buttons to product
- [ ] Create referral link generation
- [ ] Design referral landing page
- [ ] Set up tracking for referred users

## Testing & Optimization

- [ ] A/B test invitation messaging

- [ ] Add viral moments at multiple touchpoints
- [ ] Create integrations (email, calendar, etc.)
- [ ] Build community around referrals
- [ ] Gamify referral program

## Measurement & Analysis

- [ ] Track K-factor over time
- [ ] Measure viral coefficient by segment
- [ ] Analyze referral quality (are they good users?)
- [ ] Track viral loop cycle time
- [ ] Measure impact on retention
- [ ] Calculate viral loop ROI
