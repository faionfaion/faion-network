# Checklist - Growth Loops

## Identify Existing Loops

- [ ] Map all user acquisition channels
- [ ] Document how users currently generate new users
- [ ] Identify natural sharing/recommendation moments
- [ ] Map content creation by users
- [ ] Analyze revenue reinvestment potential
- [ ] Find network effect opportunities

## Loop Design

- [ ] Choose primary loop type (viral/content/paid/network/supply)
- [ ] Map all steps in the loop
- [ ] Identify conversion rate at each step
- [ ] Calculate overall loop efficiency
- [ ] Measure cycle time (days/weeks)
- [ ] Create loop diagram

## Measure Baseline

- [ ] Calculate current loop efficiency
- [ ] Determine if loop is growing (efficiency > 1.0)
- [ ] Measure each step's conversion
- [ ] Find the bottleneck step
- [ ] Calculate K-factor (viral loops)
- [ ] Set baseline metrics

## Design Bottleneck Fix

- [ ] Test highest-impact improvement
- [ ] Design A/B test for bottleneck
- [ ] Measure improvement in conversion
- [ ] Calculate impact on overall efficiency
- [ ] Run winner-only version
- [ ] Iterate to next bottleneck

## Optimize for Speed

- [ ] Reduce time between steps
- [ ] Automate manual steps
- [ ] Simplify user actions
- [ ] Pre-fill information
- [ ] Reduce decision points
- [ ] Measure cycle time reduction

## Build Secondary Loops

- [ ] Identify secondary growth drivers
- [ ] Design complementary loop
- [ ] Implement without disrupting primary
- [ ] Measure combined growth impact
- [ ] Optimize secondary loop
- [ ] Plan tertiary loops (paid)

## Implement & Track

- [ ] Set up loop analytics dashboard
- [ ] Create funnel tracking
- [ ] Configure conversion tracking at each step
- [ ] Set efficiency baseline
- [ ] Monitor daily loop metrics
- [ ] Create alerts for anomalies

## Compounding Analysis

- [ ] Calculate growth curve projection
- [ ] Determine doubling time
- [ ] Project 6-month, 1-year growth
- [ ] Find tipping point for viral takeover
- [ ] Plan marketing spend reduction
- [ ] Establish success milestones
