# Checklist - Viral Metrics

## Understand Viral Dynamics

- [ ] Learn K-factor formula (invites × conversion rate)
- [ ] Understand exponential growth curve
- [ ] Calculate viral cycle time
- [ ] Understand viral coefficient thresholds
- [ ] Learn K-factor vs organic growth
- [ ] Document viral growth dynamics

## Calculate K-Factor

- [ ] Define referral event (when invite sent)
- [ ] Track total invites per user (average)
- [ ] Measure referral-to-signup conversion rate
- [ ] Calculate K-factor = invites × conversion
- [ ] Set baseline K-factor
- [ ] Document calculation methodology

## Measure Viral Metrics

- [ ] Invite rate (% of users who invite)
- [ ] Invites per user (average)
- [ ] Invite conversion rate (% who sign up)
- [ ] Viral coefficient (K-factor)
- [ ] Viral cycle time (days)
- [ ] Viral growth rate

## Analyze Virality by Segment

- [ ] Calculate K-factor by user type
- [ ] Segment virality by acquisition channel
- [ ] Compare virality by user cohort
- [ ] Analyze virality trends over time
- [ ] Find highest virality segments
- [ ] Identify viral power users

## Track Viral Loop Metrics

- [ ] Days from sign-up to first invite
- [ ] % of users who never invite
- [ ] Distribution of invites (mode/median/mean)
- [ ] Referral quality (retention of referred users)
- [ ] Viral vs organic user retention comparison
- [ ] Cost per viral user acquisition

## Benchmark Against Competitors

- [ ] Research competitor K-factors
- [ ] Compare invite rates
- [ ] Analyze competitor referral mechanics
- [ ] Benchmark viral cycle times
- [ ] Study viral incentive structures
- [ ] Research industry viral benchmarks

## Growth Projections

- [ ] Calculate doubling time with current K-factor
- [ ] Project growth curve (6 months, 1 year)
- [ ] Determine K-factor needed for target growth
- [ ] Identify viral tipping point
- [ ] Calculate total addressable market penetration
- [ ] Plan growth milestones

## Dashboarding & Monitoring

- [ ] Create K-factor dashboard
- [ ] Track viral metrics daily
- [ ] Set up viral growth alerts
- [ ] Create cohort viral analysis
- [ ] Build segment viral views
- [ ] Generate weekly viral reports
