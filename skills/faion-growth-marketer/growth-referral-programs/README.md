## Problem

Your best marketing channel is word-of-mouth, but you're leaving it to chance. Without a structured referral program, you miss free growth from your happiest customers.

Most referral programs fail because they offer weak incentives, are hard to use, or are promoted poorly. Customers forget they exist.

---

## Framework

Referral programs follow the TRIGGER-ACTION-REWARD model:

```
TRIGGER → ACTION → REWARD
   ↓         ↓        ↓
 When?   How easy?  Worth it?
```

### Step 1: Design Your Reward Structure

**Reward types:**

| Type | Best For | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Double-sided** | SaaS, subscriptions | Both get $20 |
| **Referrer only** | Low-margin products | Referrer gets 20% off |
| **Referee only** | High-friction signup | New user gets free month |
| **Tiered** | Power users | More referrals = bigger rewards |
| **Cash** | Wide appeal | Direct payment |
| **Credit** | Retention | Account credit |

**Best practice:** Double-sided rewards perform best. Both parties feel they're winning.

**Reward sizing:**

```
Rule of thumb: Referral reward should be 20-50% of
customer acquisition cost (CAC)

If CAC = $100, reward = $20-50 per successful referral

For subscription:
- Free month
- Percentage discount
- Account credit

For e-commerce:
- $ off next purchase
- Free product
- Store credit
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Trigger Points

**Best times to ask for referrals:**

| Trigger | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Post-purchase** | Excited about new product |
| **After positive review** | Already expressing satisfaction |
| **After support win** | Just solved their problem |
| **Feature milestone** | Achieved value |
| **Subscription renewal** | Reconfirmed value |
| **App share moment** | Natural sharing context |

**Don't ask when:**
- First visit (no relationship)
- After complaint (wrong timing)
- During checkout (distracting)

### Step 3: Make It Frictionless

**Sharing options:**

1. **Unique link** - One click to copy
2. **Email invite** - Pre-written message
3. **Social share** - Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn buttons
4. **QR code** - Physical/in-person
5. **In-app invite** - For mobile apps

**Reduce friction:**

| Friction Point | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| Hard to find | Prominent placement in account |
| Complicated process | One-click sharing |
| Long referral link | Custom short URLs |
| No tracking | Real-time dashboard |
| Delayed reward | Instant or fast fulfillment |

### Step 4: Promote Your Program

**Promotion channels:**

| Channel | How to Use |
|---------|------------|
| **Email** | Dedicated announcement + periodic reminders |
| **In-app** | Dashboard widget, post-purchase modal |
| **Social** | Announce program, share success stories |
| **Website** | Dedicated landing page |
| **Support** | Mention after positive interactions |

**Email sequence:**

```
Email 1: Program announcement
Email 2: Success story (customer who earned rewards)
Email 3: Reminder with current reward status
Email 4: Limited-time bonus (double rewards)
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Weak reward | Not motivating | Test higher rewards |
| Referrer-only reward | Friend feels used | Double-sided |
| Hidden program | Nobody knows | Prominent promotion |
| Complex rules | Confusing | Simple = better |

| No reminders | Forgotten | Periodic nudges |

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Good |
|--------|---------|------|
| Participation rate | Referrers / Total customers | 10-15% |
| Referral rate | Referrals / Referrers | 2-5 per referrer |
| Conversion rate | Signups / Clicks | 10-25% |
| Viral coefficient | Referrals x Conversion | >0.5 |
| CAC via referral | Program cost / Referred customers | <50% of paid CAC |

**Viral coefficient (K-factor):**
```
K = Invites per user x Conversion rate

If each user invites 5 friends and 20% convert:
K = 5 x 0.2 = 1.0 (viral growth!)

K > 1 = Exponential growth
K = 0.5-1 = Good supplement to other channels
K < 0.5 = Needs improvement
```
