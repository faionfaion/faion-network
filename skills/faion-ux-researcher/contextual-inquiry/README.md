## Problem

User interviews happen in artificial settings. People describe what they think they do, not what they actually do. Important context is lost when removed from the real environment. Workarounds and tacit knowledge remain hidden. Reported behavior differs from actual behavior.

Without contextual inquiry:
- Missing environmental context
- Inaccurate behavior reports
- Hidden workarounds not discovered
- Tacit knowledge stays tacit

---

## Framework

### What is Contextual Inquiry?

Contextual inquiry is a semi-structured interview method conducted in the user's environment while they perform their actual work. The researcher observes and asks questions as activities unfold.

### Four Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Context** | Go to the user's workplace |
| **Partnership** | User is expert, researcher learns |
| **Interpretation** | Share interpretations, get corrections |
| **Focus** | Clear research questions guide session |

### When to Use

| Situation | Contextual Inquiry Appropriate |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Understanding workflows | Yes |
| Discovering workarounds | Yes |
| Early discovery phase | Yes |
| Complex work environments | Yes |
| Remote users only | Use remote variation |
| Quick feedback needed | No, use usability testing |

---

## Process

### Step 1: Prepare

**Define focus:**
- What aspects of work to observe?
- What questions to answer?
- Who are the right participants?

**Plan logistics:**
- Schedule 1-2 hours per session
- Get permission from organization
- Prepare recording equipment
- Create observation guide

### Step 2: Conduct Introduction

```
Opening script:
"I'm here to learn how you do your work. You're the expert.
I'll watch and ask questions. Please do your work as normally
as possible. If you explain something I don't understand,
I'll ask. If I interpret something wrong, please correct me."
```

### Step 3: Observe and Interview

**Master-apprentice model:**
- User is the master (expert)
- Researcher is the apprentice (learner)

**During observation:**
- Watch silently at first
- Ask about specific actions: "Why did you do that?"
- Share interpretations: "So it seems like..."
- Get corrections: "Did I understand correctly?"

### Step 4: Capture Data

**What to capture:**
- Actions taken
- Tools used
- Artifacts created/used
- Physical environment
- Interruptions
- Workarounds
- Frustrations expressed

### Step 5: Debrief Immediately

After each session:
- Review notes
- Highlight key insights
- Note follow-up questions
- Capture initial interpretations

### Step 6: Analyze Across Sessions

After all sessions:
- Identify patterns
- Create affinity diagrams
- Develop models (flow, sequence, cultural)
- Generate insights

## Examples

### Example 1: Healthcare Workflow

**Focus:** How nurses document patient information

**Observation:**
```
10:15 - Nurse enters patient room with laptop on cart
10:16 - Checks paper notes from pocket before entering vitals
10:18 - System times out, re-enters credentials (3rd time this hour)
10:20 - Leaves notes on "sticky" because form doesn't have right field

Interpretation shared: "It seems like you keep paper notes
because the system doesn't capture everything?"

Correction: "Exactly. The allergies field is too small and
I need to remember to tell the doctor about the new reaction."
```

**Insight:** System timeouts and form limitations cause workarounds that risk information loss.

### Example 2: Financial Analysis

**Focus:** How analysts prepare reports

**Discovery:**
- Analyst copies data from 3 systems to Excel
- Manually reformats because formats don't match
- Keeps personal templates not shared with team
- Emails report as PDF despite having report system

**Insight:** Official tools don't support actual workflow, causing shadow IT usage.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Interviewing without observing** - Asking questions but not watching work
2. **Leading the user** - "Wouldn't it be easier if..."
3. **Not sharing interpretations** - Missing chances for correction
4. **Disrupting normal work** - Causing artificial behavior
5. **Single session only** - Missing variation and edge cases

## Tips for Success

### Building Rapport

```
Do:
- Express genuine curiosity
- Show respect for their expertise
- Thank them for teaching you
- Be patient during slow periods

Don't:
- Judge their methods
- Suggest improvements during session
- Express surprise at workarounds
- Rush them
```

### Capturing Rich Data

```
Types of notes:
- Actions: What they did
- Artifacts: What they used/created
- Environment: Physical context
- Quotes: Exact words (important!)
- Breakdowns: When things didn't work
- Interpretations: Your understanding (marked as such)
```

## Remote Contextual Inquiry

When in-person not possible:

| Adaptation | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Video call** | Screen share + webcam showing environment |
| **Self-documentation** | User records themselves working |
| **Diary study** | User logs activities over time |
| **Remote screen recording** | Observe actual work sessions |

**Limitations:**
- Less environmental context
- Harder to see physical artifacts
- May miss peripheral activities
- Technology can feel more intrusive

---

## Analysis Methods

### Affinity Diagram

Group observations across participants:
1. Write each observation on sticky note
2. Cluster related observations
3. Name the clusters
4. Identify themes

### Sequence Model

Map the steps in workflows:
- Actions taken
- Decisions made
- Artifacts used
- Handoffs between people

### Cultural Model

Understand organizational context:
- Power dynamics
- Team communication
- Formal vs. informal processes
- Values and priorities
