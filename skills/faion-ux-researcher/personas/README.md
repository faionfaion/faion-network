# Personas

## Metadata
- **Category:** UX / Research Methods
- **Difficulty:** Beginner
- **Tags:** #methodology #ux #research #personas #user-centered

## Problem

Teams design for themselves instead of users. Different team members have different ideas of who the user is. Discussions about features become opinion battles. Nobody can answer "would our user want this?" Without shared understanding, products miss the mark.

Without personas:
- Design by assumption
- Team disagreement
- Features nobody wants
- Poor user experience

---

## Framework

### What are Personas?

Personas are fictional characters representing key user types. They are based on research and help teams make user-centered decisions.

### Types of Personas

| Type | Based On | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Research-based** | User research data | Most reliable |
| **Provisional** | Assumptions (to validate) | Starting point |
| **Proto-personas** | Team's current understanding | Quick alignment |

### Persona Elements

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Name and photo** | Makes persona real |
| **Demographics** | Context |
| **Goals** | What they want to achieve |
| **Frustrations** | Pain points |
| **Behaviors** | How they act |
| **Quote** | Captures attitude |
| **Scenario** | Usage context |

## Process

### Step 1: Conduct Research

Data sources for personas:
- User interviews (primary)
- Surveys
- Analytics data
- Support tickets
- Sales team input
- Customer data

### Step 2: Identify Patterns

Look for clusters of users with:
- Similar goals
- Similar behaviors
- Similar pain points
- Similar contexts

### Step 3: Create Personas

**Number of personas:**
- 3-5 primary personas
- Focus on distinct user types
- Avoid too many (dilutes focus)

### Step 4: Validate

- Review with stakeholders
- Test with team members
- Refine based on feedback
- Update as you learn more

### Step 5: Use Personas

- Reference in design discussions
- Include in requirements
- Guide feature decisions
- Share across organization

## Examples

### Example Persona

```markdown
# Persona: Sarah, The Busy Manager

**"I need to make decisions quickly and confidently"**

## Demographics
- **Age:** 38
- **Role:** Marketing Manager
- **Location:** Urban, US

## Quote
> "I don't have time to dig through dashboards. Just tell me

## About
Sarah manages a team of 8 and oversees marketing campaigns.
She's constantly in meetings and checks reports between
calls. She values efficiency and clear communication.

## Goals
1. Get quick insights on campaign performance
2. Report results to leadership with confidence
3. Make data-driven decisions without becoming a data analyst

## Frustrations
1. Reports that require too many clicks to understand
2. Data presented without context or recommendations
3. Tools that require training to use effectively

## Behaviors
- Checks dashboards on mobile between meetings
- Prefers summaries over detailed data
- Delegates deep analysis to team members
- Trusts tools that save her time

## Context
- **When:** Early morning, between meetings
- **Where:** Office, commute, home
- **Devices:** Laptop at desk, phone on the go

## Scenario
Monday 9am: Sarah has 10 minutes before her weekly
leadership meeting. She opens the app on her phone,
sees the key metrics summary, notes that Campaign A
is underperforming, and has talking points ready.

## Key Insights for Design
- Mobile experience is critical
- Default to summary views, allow drill-down
- Highlight anomalies and recommendations
- Export-friendly for presentations
```

## Anti-Patterns

### What Personas Are NOT

| NOT | Instead |
|-----|---------|
| Marketing segments | User behavior and goals |
| Demographic profiles | Motivations and context |
| One-size-fits-all | Distinct user types |
| Static documents | Living references |
| Pretty posters | Decision-making tools |

### Signs of Bad Personas

- Nobody uses them
- Too many personas
- No research basis
- Just demographics
- No actionable insights

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Made up without research** - Personas reinforce assumptions
2. **Too many personas** - Team cannot remember them
3. **Just demographics** - Missing goals and behaviors
4. **Never updated** - Become outdated
5. **Created but not used** - No impact on decisions

---

## Using Personas Effectively

### In Design Reviews

```
"Would Sarah understand this dashboard view?"
"How would this feature help Sarah's goal of quick insights?"
```

### In Requirements

```
User Story: As Sarah, I want to see a performance summary
so that I can quickly prepare for meetings.
```

### In Prioritization

```
"This feature helps Sarah (primary persona) but not Tom
(secondary). Prioritize for Sarah."
```

---

## Jobs-to-be-Done Connection

Personas + JTBD = powerful combination

```
Persona: WHO is using the product
JTBD: WHAT job they're hiring it for

Sarah (persona) hires the dashboard (product) to
make her look informed in leadership meetings (job).
```
