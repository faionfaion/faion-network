## Execution Process

### Step 1: Monitor and Engage

During the study:
- Check completion rates
- Send reminders
- Answer questions
- Provide encouragement
- Monitor data quality

### Step 2: Quality Assurance

**Entry Quality Checks:**

| Issue | Detection | Response |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Generic entries** | Same text, low detail | Prompt for specifics |
| **Missed days** | Gap in submissions | Gentle reminder |
| **Copy-paste** | Identical entries | Follow-up call |
| **Off-topic** | Unrelated content | Clarify scope |

**Validity Considerations:**

```
Potential biases:
- Social desirability (reporting what seems "right")
- Memory reconstruction (not truly in-the-moment)
- Observation effect (behavior changes when studied)
- Fatigue effects (declining quality over time)

Mitigation:
- Emphasize honesty
- Use signal-contingent prompts
- Keep study duration reasonable
- Monitor and discuss in follow-up
```

### Step 3: Participant Engagement

**Keeping Participation High:**

```
Strategies:
- Personal onboarding call
- Regular encouragement
- Respond to entries (within reason)
- Gamification elements
- Milestone incentives
- Clear end date
```

**Handling Drop-Off:**

```
Prevention:
- Set realistic expectations
- Screen for commitment
- Make entries quick and easy
- Provide incentive milestones

Recovery:
- Check in personally
- Understand barriers
- Adjust if possible
- Partial incentive for partial completion
```

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Organize Data

**Structure:**
1. By participant (individual journey)
2. By time (patterns over study)
3. By theme (cross-participant patterns)
4. By question (specific responses)

### Step 2: Timeline Visualization

```
Day:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
P1:     +  +  +  -  -  +  +  +  +  +
P2:     +  +  -  -  +  +  +  +  +  +
P3:     +  -  -  -  -  X  X  X  X  X

+ = positive experience
- = negative experience
X = no entry

Pattern: Day 3-5 common frustration point
```

### Step 3: Thematic Analysis

**Analysis approaches:**
- Thematic analysis across entries
- Timeline analysis per participant
- Pattern identification
- Quote extraction
- Quantitative trends

### Step 4: Follow-Up Interviews

After diary period:
- Clarify unclear entries
- Explore patterns noticed
- Gather overall reflections
- Fill in gaps

# Diary Study Analysis

**Study:** [Name]
**Duration:** [X days/weeks]
**Participants:** [N]
**Total entries:** [N]

## Participation Summary

| Participant | Entries | Avg/Day | Completion |
|-------------|---------|---------|------------|
| P1 | [N] | [N] | [%] |
| P2 | [N] | [N] | [%] |

## Key Themes

### Theme 1: [Name]

**Description:** [What this theme is about]

**Frequency:** [How often it appeared]

**Example entries:**
- "[Quote]" - P1, Day 3
- "[Quote]" - P4, Day 7

**Insight:** [What this tells us]

### Theme 2: [Name]

[Same structure]

## Temporal Patterns

### Early Period (Days 1-X)
- [Pattern observed]
- [Behavior noted]

### Middle Period (Days X-Y)
- [Pattern observed]
- [Behavior noted]

### Late Period (Days Y-Z)
- [Pattern observed]
- [Behavior noted]

## Context Analysis

| Context | Frequency | Associated Experience |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| [Context] | [%] | [Positive/Negative/Mixed] |

## Quantitative Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average satisfaction rating | [X/5] |
| % entries with problems | [%] |
| Most common trigger | [Trigger] |

## Analysis Tips

### Organizing Data

```
Structure:
1. By participant (individual journey)
2. By time (patterns over study)
3. By theme (cross-participant patterns)
4. By question (specific responses)
```

### Looking for Patterns

```
Temporal patterns:
- Behavior changes over time
- Learning curves
- Habit formation points
- Drop-off triggers

Contextual patterns:
- Location-based behaviors
- Device preferences
- Time-of-day patterns
- Mood correlations

Thematic patterns:
- Recurring problems
- Common delighters
- Unmet needs
- Workarounds
```

### Quantitative Analysis

**Metrics to track:**
- Completion rates
- Satisfaction trends
- Feature usage frequency
- Problem occurrence rates
- Context distributions

**Visualization:**
- Line charts for trends over time
- Heat maps for time/context patterns
- Bar charts for frequency data
- Journey maps for participant stories

---

## Common Analysis Mistakes

1. **Cherry-picking** - Only reporting positive/interesting findings
2. **Ignoring outliers** - Extreme cases often reveal important insights
3. **Losing context** - Analyzing entries without participant journey
4. **Over-quantifying** - Missing rich qualitative insights
5. **Confirmation bias** - Only seeing what you expected
