## Problem

Users make mistakes and cannot easily recover. They click something accidentally and are trapped. They start a process and cannot go back. They change settings and cannot restore defaults. Users feel helpless and frustrated when they lose control.

Without user control:
- Users feel trapped
- Mistakes are costly
- Fear of exploration
- Abandonment

---

## The Heuristic

**Usability Heuristic #3:** Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.

---

## Framework

### Key Principles

1. **Undo and redo** - Reverse any action
2. **Emergency exits** - Easy way out
3. **Cancel operations** - Stop ongoing processes
4. **Forgiving design** - Easy recovery from mistakes

### Control Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Undo** | Reverse last action | Ctrl+Z, Undo button |
| **Redo** | Restore undone action | Ctrl+Y, Redo button |
| **Cancel** | Stop current operation | Cancel button, Escape key |
| **Back** | Return to previous state | Back button, breadcrumbs |
| **Close** | Exit current context | X button, click outside |
| **Reset** | Restore defaults | Reset to default button |

---

## Implementation Patterns

### Undo/Redo

**Simple undo:**
```
Action: User deletes item
Feedback: "Item deleted" + [Undo] button
Undo: Item restored to original position
```

**Multi-level undo:**
```
Store history of actions
Allow stepping back multiple times
Show undo history if many actions
```

### Cancel Operations

**Form editing:**
```
User editing profile
[Save] [Cancel]
Cancel = discard changes, return to view mode
```

**Long operations:**
```
Upload in progress... [Cancel]
Processing... (cannot be cancelled - explain why)
```

### Emergency Exits

**Modal dialogs:**
```
- X button in corner
- Click outside to close
- Escape key to close
- Cancel button visible
```

**Multi-step processes:**
```
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Complete
  [Back] available on each step
  [Cancel/Exit] available throughout
```

### Confirmation Dialogs

**Destructive actions only:**
```
Delete item?
This action cannot be undone.
[Cancel] [Delete]
```

**Do not overuse:**
```
Bad: "Are you sure you want to leave?" on every exit
Good: Only confirm for unsaved changes
```

## Control Mechanisms

| Action | Undo Available? | Cancel Available? | Recovery Method |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [Action] | Y/N | Y/N | [How to recover] |

## Exit Points

| Context | Exit Available? | Method | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| [Context] | Y/N | [Method] | [Notes] |

## Destructive Actions

| Action | Confirmation? | Undo? | Warning Level |

| [Action] | Y/N | Y/N | [Appropriate?] |

## Gaps and Recommendations

| Issue | Impact | Recommendation |

## Examples

### Good Examples

**Google Docs:**
- Extensive undo/redo history
- Version history to restore any point
- Auto-save (no lost work)
- "Restore" option for deleted files

**Gmail:**
- "Undo send" for recently sent emails
- Move to trash (not permanent delete)
- Recover from trash within 30 days

**Figma:**
- Ctrl+Z for unlimited undo
- Version history
- Components can be detached/restored

### Bad Examples

**No escape:**
```
Wizard: Step 5 of 10
[Next] (no back button, no exit)
User cannot leave without completing
```

**Immediate permanent delete:**
```
[Delete] clicked
Item gone immediately
No confirmation, no undo, no recovery
```

**Forced modal:**
```
Newsletter popup
No X button, no close option
User must subscribe or refresh page
```

## Design Recommendations

### When to Confirm

| Action Type | Confirm? | Undo Instead? |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Delete item | Soft delete | Yes, undo |
| Permanent delete | Yes, confirm | N/A |
| Discard unsaved | If significant | Consider auto-save |
| Cancel subscription | Yes, explain impact | N/A |
| Routine action | No | Undo if needed |

### Undo vs. Confirmation

**Prefer undo when:**
- Action is frequent
- Recovery is possible
- Impact is moderate

**Prefer confirmation when:**
- Action is irreversible
- Impact is severe
- Action is rare

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **No undo** - Actions cannot be reversed
2. **Hidden exits** - Hard to find back/cancel
3. **Confirmation overuse** - "Are you sure?" everywhere
4. **Trapped in flows** - Cannot exit multi-step process
5. **Unclear consequences** - Users do not know what cancel does

---

## Accessibility Considerations

- Keyboard shortcuts for undo/redo
- Focus management in modals
- Clear button labels (not just icons)
- Screen reader announcements for undo
- Escape key always works

---

## Checklist

- [ ] All actions have undo (where technically possible)
- [ ] Cancel buttons are visible in all forms/dialogs
- [ ] Modals can be closed via X, Escape, outside click
- [ ] Multi-step processes have back navigation
- [ ] Destructive actions require confirmation
- [ ] Non-destructive actions do not over-confirm
- [ ] Deleted items go to trash (soft delete)
- [ ] Users can reset to default settings
