# Customer Journey Mapping

## Problem

You optimize individual touchpoints but miss the overall experience. Users face friction between channels. Handoffs between departments cause problems. Nobody sees the complete user experience from start to finish. Improvements in one area create problems in another.

Without journey mapping:
- Fragmented experience
- Missed pain points
- Siloed improvements
- Poor end-to-end experience

---

## Framework

### What is Journey Mapping?

A journey map visualizes the complete experience a user has with a product or service over time, including their actions, thoughts, and emotions at each stage.

### Journey Map Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Persona** | Who is taking the journey |
| **Stages** | Major phases of the experience |
| **Actions** | What user does at each stage |
| **Touchpoints** | Where interaction happens |
| **Thoughts** | What user is thinking |
| **Emotions** | How user feels |
| **Pain points** | Friction and frustrations |
| **Opportunities** | Improvement areas |

### Journey Types

| Type | Scope | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Current state** | How things are today | Find problems |
| **Future state** | Ideal experience | Design target |
| **Day-in-the-life** | Broader context | Understand user |
| **Service blueprint** | Include backstage | Operational view |

---

## Process

### Step 1: Define Scope

```
Questions to answer:
- Which persona?
- Which journey? (purchase, onboarding, support)
- Start and end points?
- Which channels?
```

### Step 2: Gather Research

**Data sources:**
- User interviews
- Observation
- Analytics
- Support data
- Surveys
- Employee interviews

### Step 3: Identify Stages

Break journey into major phases:

```
Example e-commerce journey:
Awareness → Research → Purchase → Delivery → Use → Support
```

### Step 4: Map Actions and Touchpoints

For each stage:
- What does the user do?
- Where do they interact?
- What channels are involved?

### Step 5: Add Emotions and Thoughts

For each stage:
- How does the user feel?
- What are they thinking?
- What questions do they have?

### Step 6: Identify Pain Points and Opportunities

- Where is friction?
- What causes frustration?
- Where are the biggest gaps?
- What could be improved?

### Step 7: Visualize the Map

Create a visual representation showing all elements across stages.

## Examples

### E-commerce Purchase Journey

**Stages:** Discover → Research → Decide → Purchase → Receive → Use

| Stage | Actions | Emotions | Pain Points |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Discover | Search, see ad | Curious | Hard to find what I need |
| Research | Compare options | Engaged | Too many choices |
| Decide | Read reviews | Uncertain | Conflicting reviews |
| Purchase | Checkout | Anxious | Long form, hidden fees |
| Receive | Track, wait | Impatient | No tracking updates |
| Use | Unbox, try | Excited/Disappointed | Not as expected |

### Key Insight
Checkout is the biggest drop-off point. Simplifying checkout could increase conversion by 15%.
