# Information Architecture - Framework

## Problem

Users cannot find what they need. Content organization matches the company, not users. Navigation is confusing and inconsistent. Search is the only way to find anything. Adding new content breaks existing structure. Different teams organize content differently.

Without proper IA:
- Low findability
- User frustration
- Increased support costs
- Poor scalability

## Framework

### What is Information Architecture?

Information architecture (IA) is the structural design of shared information environments. It involves organizing, labeling, and creating navigation systems that help users find and understand information.

### IA Components

| Component | What it is | Examples |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Organization** | How content is grouped | Categories, sections |
| **Labeling** | How content is named | Menu items, headings |
| **Navigation** | How users move through | Menus, links, breadcrumbs |
| **Search** | How users query | Search box, filters |

### IA Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Findability** | Users can locate what they need |
| **Understandability** | Labels make sense to users |
| **Scalability** | Structure works as content grows |
| **Flexibility** | Content can live in multiple contexts |

---

## Process

### Step 1: Research

**Understand the content:**
- Content inventory
- Content types and relationships
- Growth projections

**Understand users:**
- User research
- Mental models
- Common tasks and goals

**Understand business:**
- Business goals
- Key content priorities
- Governance needs

### Step 2: Define Strategy

Based on research, determine:

```
Questions:
- What are the primary user tasks?
- What content is most important?
- How will users expect to find things?
- How will this scale?
```

### Step 3: Create Organization Schemes

**Common schemes:**

| Scheme | How it works | Best for |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Topic** | By subject matter | Content sites |
| **Task** | By user goal | Tool/app UIs |
| **Audience** | By user type | Multi-audience sites |
| **Alphabetical** | A-Z order | Directories, glossaries |
| **Chronological** | By date | News, blogs |
| **Geographic** | By location | Location-based services |

### Step 4: Define Taxonomy

Create consistent naming:

```
Taxonomy elements:
- Categories (top-level groups)
- Subcategories (nested groups)
- Tags (cross-cutting labels)
- Metadata (structured attributes)
```

### Step 5: Design Navigation

**Navigation types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Global** | Appears on every page |
| **Local** | Within a section |
| **Contextual** | Related content links |
| **Utility** | Account, help, settings |
| **Footer** | Secondary links, legal |
| **Breadcrumbs** | Location in hierarchy |

### Step 6: Validate

Test with users:
- Card sorting (organization)
- Tree testing (findability)
- Usability testing (real use)

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Org chart navigation** - Matching internal structure, not user needs
2. **Too deep** - More than 3-4 levels
3. **Too many choices** - More than 7 items per level
4. **Jargon labels** - Internal terminology users don't know
5. **No testing** - Assumptions not validated

---

## IA Artifacts

| Artifact | Purpose | When |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Sitemap** | Visual hierarchy | Throughout |
| **Taxonomy** | Classification rules | Early |
| **Navigation spec** | Menu design | Mid-late |
| **Page tables** | Content requirements | Mid |
| **Wireframes** | Layout with navigation | Late |
