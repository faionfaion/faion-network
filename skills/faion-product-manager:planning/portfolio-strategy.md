## Portfolio Strategy (70/20/10)

### Problem

Economic uncertainty requires balanced product bets.

### Solution: Three Horizons Portfolio Model

**Portfolio Allocation:**

| Horizon | Allocation | Focus | Risk Level |
|---------|------------|-------|------------|
| Core (H1) | 70% | Consistent revenue | Low |
| Adjacent (H2) | 20% | New markets/segments | Medium |
| Transformational (H3) | 10% | Breakthrough innovation | High |

**Portfolio by Economic Condition:**

| Condition | Adjust To |
|-----------|-----------|
| Growth economy | 60/25/15 (more bets) |
| Stable economy | 70/20/10 (standard) |
| Recession | 80/15/5 (protect core) |

**Horizon Definitions:**
```
H1 - Core: Incremental improvements to existing products
    - Timeframe: 0-12 months
    - Metrics: Revenue, retention, efficiency
    - Risk: Low, known market

H2 - Adjacent: Extensions to new markets or segments
    - Timeframe: 12-24 months
    - Metrics: Market validation, early revenue
    - Risk: Medium, some unknowns

H3 - Transformational: New business models or technologies
    - Timeframe: 24-36 months
    - Metrics: Learning velocity, option value
    - Risk: High, many unknowns
```

**Key Insight 2026:** Economic growth predicted to weaken through 2026 (Morgan Stanley). Product managers must balance high-risk, high-reward initiatives with stable, revenue-generating products.
