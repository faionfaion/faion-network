## Outcome-Based Roadmaps

### Problem

Feature-based roadmaps commit to solutions before validating problems.

### Solution: Outcome-Based Planning

**Feature Roadmap vs Outcome Roadmap:**

| Feature Roadmap | Outcome Roadmap |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "Build chat feature" | "Reduce support tickets by 30%" |
| "Add dark mode" | "Improve evening retention" |
| "Launch mobile app" | "Enable on-the-go usage" |

**Outcome Roadmap Structure:**
```
Q1: Reduce churn from 8% to 5%
    - Experiments to run
    - Metrics to track
    - Potential solutions (not committed)
    - Success criteria

Q2: Increase activation rate to 40%
    - ...
```

**Benefits:**
- Flexibility to pivot solutions
- Alignment on goals, not features
- Room for discovery
- Better stakeholder conversations

**How to Present:**
- Lead with the problem and outcome
- Show data supporting the priority
- Present options, not THE solution
- Include success metrics
