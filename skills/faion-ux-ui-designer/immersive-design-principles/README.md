# Immersive Design Principles

### Problem

Immersion can overwhelm or disorient users.

### Solution: Balanced Immersive Design

**Immersion Levels:**

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Passthrough | Real world + overlays | AR navigation |
| Blended | Mixed real/virtual | MR workspace |
| Immersive | Full virtual environment | VR experience |
| Portal | Windows into virtual | VR meetings |

**Design Guidelines:**
```
→ Use depth and layering thoughtfully
→ Implement realistic motion physics
→ Respond to environmental context
→ Transition smoothly between modes
→ Ensure immersion enhances, not distracts
```

**Motion and Comfort:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Motion sickness | Fixed reference points, reduced motion |
| Disorientation | Clear grounding, consistent horizon |
| Eye strain | Proper depth of field, breaks |
| Arm fatigue | Support positions, alternative inputs |

## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|
| Design token implementation | haiku | Pattern application: applying design tokens to components |
