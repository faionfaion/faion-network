# Spatial UX Fundamentals

### Problem

2D UI patterns don't translate to 3D spatial interfaces.

### Solution: Spatial-First Design Principles

**Core Considerations:**

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Scale | UI elements at appropriate world-scale |
| Reach | Content within comfortable arm reach |
| Sight-lines | No content in peripheral blind spots |
| Occlusion | Handle content blocking |
| Orientation | Maintain spatial consistency |
| Environment | Adapt to physical surroundings |

**Spatial Hierarchy:**
```
Near field (0-1m):
→ Primary interactions
→ Menus, controls
→ Immediate feedback

Mid field (1-3m):
→ Content consumption
→ Work surfaces
→ Collaboration space

Far field (3m+):
→ Environmental context
→ Navigation aids
→ Background content
```
