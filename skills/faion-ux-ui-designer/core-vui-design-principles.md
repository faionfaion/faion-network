# Core VUI Design Principles

### Problem

Voice interfaces fail when designed like visual interfaces.

### Solution: Voice-First Design Principles

**Principle 1: Simplicity and Clarity**
```
DO:
"Your order is confirmed for delivery tomorrow."

DON'T:
"Your order has been successfully processed and
scheduled for delivery on January 20th at a time
between 9 AM and 5 PM in your local timezone."
```

**Principle 2: Natural Conversation**
```
DO:
User: "What's the weather?"
VUI: "It's 72 degrees and sunny. Should I tell you about tomorrow?"

DON'T:
User: "What's the weather?"
VUI: "The current temperature is 72 degrees Fahrenheit
with sunny conditions. Humidity is 45 percent."
```

**Principle 3: Context Awareness**
- Remember previous conversation turns
- Understand follow-up questions
- Maintain context across sessions
- Adapt to user preferences
