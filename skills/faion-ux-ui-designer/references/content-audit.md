# Content Audit

## Metadata
- **Category:** UX / Research Methods
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate
- **Tags:** #methodology #ux #research #content-audit #content-strategy
- **Agent:** faion-ux-researcher-agent

## Problem

You don't know what content exists. Duplicate content wastes resources. Outdated content hurts credibility. Content quality is inconsistent. Migration projects have no inventory. Redesign projects don't know what to include.

Without content audit:
- Unknown content inventory
- Duplicate and outdated content
- Inconsistent quality
- Failed migrations/redesigns

---

## Framework

### What is a Content Audit?

A content audit is a systematic review of all content on a website or application. It catalogs what exists, evaluates quality, and identifies what to keep, update, or remove.

### Audit Types

| Type | Purpose | Scope |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Quantitative** | Inventory what exists | Count, categorize |
| **Qualitative** | Evaluate quality | Assess against criteria |
| **Comparative** | Check consistency | Compare across content |
| **ROI-focused** | Measure performance | Analytics-driven |

### When to Audit

| Situation | Audit Needed |
|-----------|--------------|
| Website redesign | Yes (full) |
| Content strategy development | Yes (full) |
| SEO improvement | Yes (with analytics) |
| Regular maintenance | Yes (rolling) |
| New content only | No |

---

## Process

### Step 1: Define Scope and Goals

**Questions:**
- What content are we auditing? (All pages, blog only, help center)
- What do we want to learn? (What exists, what's performing)
- How will we use results? (Migration, strategy, cleanup)

**Set evaluation criteria:**
- Accuracy
- Relevance
- Quality
- Performance
- Accessibility
- SEO

### Step 2: Gather Content Inventory

**Automated methods:**
- Use site crawler (Screaming Frog, Sitebulb)
- Export from CMS
- Use sitemap

**Manual additions:**
- PDFs and downloads
- Gated content
- Dynamic content
- Legacy systems

### Step 3: Create Spreadsheet Structure

Columns to include:

| Category | Fields |
|----------|--------|
| **Identification** | URL, ID, Title |
| **Metadata** | Author, Date, Type |
| **Taxonomy** | Category, Tags |
| **Status** | Published, Draft |
| **Metrics** | Pageviews, Bounce rate |
| **Evaluation** | Quality score, Action |

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Piece

For each content item, assess:

```
Questions:
- Is it accurate and up-to-date?
- Is it relevant to users?
- Is it well-written?
- Does it perform well?
- Is it accessible?
- Is it SEO-optimized?
```

### Step 5: Assign Actions

| Action | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Keep** | High quality, performing well |
| **Update** | Good content, needs refresh |
| **Consolidate** | Duplicate or overlap |
| **Rewrite** | Poor quality, important topic |
| **Remove** | Outdated, irrelevant, low value |
| **Review** | Needs further evaluation |

### Step 6: Report and Recommend

Summarize findings:
- Total content count
- Content by type
- Content by action
- Priority recommendations
