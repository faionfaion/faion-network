# AI Accessibility Automation 2026

### Problem

94.8% of homepages still contain detectable WCAG 2 failures (WebAIM 2026). Manual accessibility testing doesn't scale.

### Solution: AI-Powered Accessibility Workflow

**AI Automation Capabilities:**

| Capability | Traditional | AI-Enhanced |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Issue detection | 30-50% coverage | 60-70% with context |
| False positives | High | Significantly reduced |
| Code remediation | Manual | AI-suggested fixes |
| VPAT creation | Hours | Seconds (draft) |
| Documentation | Manual write-up | Auto-generated reports |
| Issue prioritization | Manual triage | AI-ranked by impact |

**New Efficiency Tools:**
```
AI extracts automatically:
→ Code snippets
→ Screenshots
→ Success criterion mapping
→ Context for remediation
```

**Video Accessibility (ADA Title II 2026):**
- AI-enabled captioning
- AI-generated audio descriptions
- Live captioning improvements
- Multi-language support

**Human-AI Balance:**
```
AI handles:
- Repetitive scanning
- Code extraction
- Report generation
- Instant Q&A (chatbots)

Humans handle:
- Context and empathy
- Complex judgment calls
- User testing validation
- Strategic decisions
```

**Implementation:**
```
1. AI-powered automated scan → baseline report
2. AI issue extraction → developer context
3. AI fix suggestions → code recommendations
4. Human review → validation + edge cases
5. Continuous AI monitoring → regression prevention
```
