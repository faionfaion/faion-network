## Problem

Individual interviews take too long for early exploration. You need diverse perspectives quickly. Group dynamics might reveal insights individuals wouldn't share. Stakeholders want to "see" users interact. Budget limits one-on-one research.

Without focus groups:
- Slower idea exploration
- Missing group dynamics insights
- Less stakeholder buy-in
- Narrow perspective range

---

## Framework

### What are Focus Groups?

A focus group is a moderated discussion with 6-10 participants who share characteristics relevant to the research. The group explores topics, reacts to concepts, and builds on each other's ideas.

### Focus Groups vs. Interviews

| Aspect | Focus Groups | Interviews |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Participants | 6-10 together | 1 at a time |
| Duration | 60-90 minutes | 30-60 minutes |
| Dynamic | Group discussion | One-on-one |
| Best for | Exploration, reactions | Deep individual insight |
| Risk | Groupthink | Limited perspectives |

### When to Use

| Good For | Not Good For |
|----------|--------------|
| Exploring attitudes and opinions | Usability testing |
| Generating ideas | Sensitive topics |
| Testing concepts early | Individual behavior details |
| Understanding language | Consensus building |
| Quick diverse input | Final decisions |

## Process

### Step 1: Define Objectives

```
Questions to answer:
- What do we want to learn?
- Why is a group format appropriate?
- How will we use the findings?
```

### Step 2: Plan Logistics

**Group composition:**
- 6-10 participants per group
- Homogeneous enough for comfort
- Diverse enough for variety
- Run 2-4 groups minimum

**Timing:**
- 60-90 minutes duration
- Allow breaks for longer sessions

### Step 3: Create Discussion Guide

Structure the conversation:
1. **Opening** (10 min) - Introductions, ground rules
2. **Warm-up** (10 min) - Easy questions to get talking
3. **Core topics** (40-60 min) - Main research questions
4. **Wrap-up** (10 min) - Summary, final thoughts

### Step 4: Recruit Participants

**Screening criteria:**
- Match target user characteristics
- Articulate and willing to share
- Available for scheduled time
- No conflicts of interest

**Compensation:**
- Standard: $50-150 for 90 minutes
- Higher for specialized audiences

### Step 5: Moderate the Session

**Facilitator role:**
- Guide discussion without leading
- Ensure everyone participates
- Manage dominant voices
- Probe for deeper insights
- Keep on topic and time

### Step 6: Analyze Findings

- Review recordings/notes
- Identify themes across groups
- Note agreements and disagreements
- Document surprising insights
- Compare to research objectives

## Examples

### Example 1: Product Concept Testing

**Objective:** Get reactions to new app concept

**Groups:**
- Group 1: Current product users
- Group 2: Competitor users
- Group 3: Non-users of category

**Key findings:**
- Current users worried about learning new interface
- Competitor users excited about missing feature
- Non-users didn't understand core value proposition

**Insight:** Need different messaging for each segment.

### Example 2: Language Exploration

**Objective:** Understand how users talk about problem

**Exercise:** "How would you describe [problem] to a friend?"

**Findings:**
- Users say "keeping track of" not "managing"
- "Simple" preferred over "easy"
- Technical terms caused confusion

**Result:** Marketing copy updated to match user language.

## Moderation Techniques

### Encouraging Participation

```
Techniques:
- Call on quiet participants: "Sarah, what's your take?"
- Round robin: Go around the table for specific questions
- Written first: Have everyone write before discussing
- Small groups: Break into pairs, then share
```

### Managing Dynamics

```
For dominant participants:
- "Thanks, let's hear from others"
- Direct questions to others
- Sit next to them (harder to make eye contact)

For quiet participants:
- Direct but gentle questions
- Use their written responses
- Follow up on their brief comments

For conflicts:
- Acknowledge both views
- "It sounds like there are different experiences here"
- Move forward: "Let's explore both perspectives"
```

### Probing Deeper

```
Clarification: "What do you mean by...?"
Expansion: "Tell me more about that"
Reason: "Why do you feel that way?"
Example: "Can you give me an example?"
Contrast: "How does that compare to...?"
```

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Leading questions** - Suggesting the "right" answer
2. **Too many topics** - Not going deep enough
3. **Ignoring quiet voices** - Missing important perspectives
4. **Taking comments as consensus** - One loud voice isn't everyone
5. **Showing concepts too early** - Biasing the discussion
