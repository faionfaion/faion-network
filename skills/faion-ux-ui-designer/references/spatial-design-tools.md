# Spatial Design Tools

### Problem

Traditional design tools don't support spatial design.

### Solution: Spatial-Native Design Tools

**Tools Landscape:**

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| Figma (3D plugins) | 2D to 3D preview |
| ShapesXR | VR prototyping |
| Gravity Sketch | VR-native design |
| Unity | 3D development |
| Unreal Engine | High-fidelity XR |
| Reality Composer | Apple spatial design |
| Spark AR | Meta AR effects |

**Design-to-Development:**
```
Concept:
→ 2D wireframes with spatial annotations
→ Storyboard key interactions

Prototype:
→ Low-fi in ShapesXR or similar
→ Test in actual headset

Iteration:
→ Unity/Unreal high-fi prototype
→ User testing in target environment

Production:
→ Full development
→ Performance optimization
→ Accessibility review
```
