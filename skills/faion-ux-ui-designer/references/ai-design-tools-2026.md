# AI-Assisted Design Tools 2026

## M-UX-041: Figma AI Ecosystem

### Overview

Figma has evolved from a design tool to an end-to-end platform for bringing ideas to life, with AI at its core.

**Figma AI Tools (Config 2025+):**

| Tool | Function | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| Figma Make | AI-powered prototyping | Generate web apps from prompts |
| Figma Draw | Generative AI sketching | Vector graphics assistance |
| Figma Sites | AI web development | Publish directly from Figma |
| AI Image Tools | Non-prompt editing | Object erase, isolate, expand |

### Figma Make

**Capabilities:**
- Input prompt to create web application prototypes
- Collaborative editing with AI assistant
- Prompt-based element changes and additions
- Direct connection to design system tokens

**Best Practices:**
```
1. Start with clear, specific prompts
2. Use as ideation tool, not final output
3. Iterate with targeted change requests
4. Validate against brand guidelines
5. Manual refinement for production
```

### AI Image Tools (No Prompts Required)

| Feature | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Erase Objects | Select and remove unwanted elements |
| Isolate Objects | Separate subjects for moving/effects |
| Expand Images | Extend backgrounds for new formats |

**Advantage:** Works directly on canvas, no export/re-import cycle.

## M-UX-043: Generative UI Design

### Problem

Manual UI creation is time-consuming. Teams need faster ideation cycles.

### Solution: AI-First Design Workflow

**Generative UI Tools:**

| Tool | Specialization | Output Quality |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Galileo | UI generation | Production-ready |
| Uizard | Wireframe-to-design | Rapid prototypes |
| v0 (Vercel) | React component generation | Code output |
| Claude Artifacts | Interactive prototypes | Code + preview |
| Relume | Wireframe generation | Figma-ready |

**AI Design Workflow:**
```
Ideation        → AI generates options
Selection       → Human curates best
Refinement      → AI + human iteration
Brand alignment → Human verification
Implementation  → AI-assisted coding
```

**Quality Considerations:**
- AI outputs are starting points, not finals
- Brand consistency requires human oversight
- Accessibility must be manually verified
- Edge cases need human attention
