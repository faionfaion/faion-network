## Problem

You don't know what content exists. Duplicate content wastes resources. Outdated content hurts credibility. Content quality is inconsistent. Migration projects have no inventory. Redesign projects don't know what to include.

Without content audit:
- Unknown content inventory
- Duplicate and outdated content
- Inconsistent quality
- Failed migrations/redesigns

## Framework

### What is a Content Audit?

A content audit is a systematic review of all content on a website or application. It catalogs what exists, evaluates quality, and identifies what to keep, update, or remove.

### Audit Types

| Type | Purpose | Scope |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Quantitative** | Inventory what exists | Count, categorize |
| **Qualitative** | Evaluate quality | Assess against criteria |
| **Comparative** | Check consistency | Compare across content |
| **ROI-focused** | Measure performance | Analytics-driven |

### When to Audit

| Situation | Audit Needed |
|-----------|--------------|
| Website redesign | Yes (full) |
| Content strategy development | Yes (full) |
| SEO improvement | Yes (with analytics) |
| Regular maintenance | Yes (rolling) |
| New content only | No |
