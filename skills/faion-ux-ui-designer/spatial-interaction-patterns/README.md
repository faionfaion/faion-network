# Spatial Interaction Patterns

### Input Modalities

| Input | Use Case | Best For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Hand tracking | Direct manipulation | Natural interactions |
| Controllers | Precise input | Gaming, creative work |
| Gaze | Selection, navigation | Accessibility, passive |
| Voice | Commands, input | Hands-free, text entry |
| Gesture | Shortcuts, commands | Quick actions |

### Interaction Patterns

**Direct Manipulation:**
```
→ Grab and move objects
→ Pinch to resize
→ Two-hand rotation
→ Physics-based throwing
```

**Ray-Casting:**
```
→ Point at distant objects
→ Selection confirmation (click/pinch)
→ Laser pointer metaphor
→ Good for menus, far content
```

**Gaze + Dwell:**
```
→ Look at target
→ Dwell time confirms selection
→ Good for accessibility
→ Avoids arm fatigue
```

## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|
| Design pattern synthesis | sonnet | Complex integration: combining multiple patterns into coherent system |
