# M-UX-063: LLM-Powered Conversational AI

### Problem

Traditional rule-based VUI is limited in handling complex queries.

### Solution: Large Language Model Integration

**LLM Capabilities:**

| Capability | Traditional VUI | LLM-Powered VUI |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Query complexity | Simple intents | Complex, multi-part |
| Context handling | Limited slots | Full conversation history |
| Ambiguity | Fails | Interprets and clarifies |
| Follow-ups | Pre-defined | Natural continuation |
| Emotion recognition | None | Tone detection |

**Implementation Pattern:**
```
User speech
    ↓
Speech-to-text (ASR)
    ↓
LLM processing (intent + response)
    ↓
Response generation
    ↓
Text-to-speech (TTS)
    ↓
Audio output
```

**Guardrails:**
```
→ Define boundaries for LLM responses
→ Validate actions before execution
→ Maintain consistent persona
→ Handle off-topic gracefully
→ Escalate when uncertain
```
