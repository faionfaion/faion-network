# M-UX-062: VUI + IoT Integration

### Problem

Smart home devices need coherent voice control.

### Solution: Connected VUI Ecosystem

**Smart Home Patterns:**

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Direct control | "Turn off the lights" |
| Scene activation | "Goodnight" (triggers routine) |
| Status query | "Is the front door locked?" |
| Conditional | "Turn on AC when I get home" |
| Scheduling | "Turn off lights at 11 PM" |

**Multi-Device Coordination:**
```
User: "I'm leaving"
System:
→ Locks doors
→ Turns off lights
→ Adjusts thermostat
→ Arms security
→ Confirms: "Home secured. Have a good day."
```

**Best Practices:**
```
→ Group devices logically
→ Create intuitive scene names
→ Provide feedback for each action
→ Handle partial failures gracefully
→ Allow undo for recent actions
```
