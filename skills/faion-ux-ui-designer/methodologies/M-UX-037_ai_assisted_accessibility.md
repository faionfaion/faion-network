# M-UX-037: AI-Assisted Accessibility

### Problem

Accessibility testing is time-consuming. Manual audits require significant expertise.

### Solution: AI Tools for Accessibility

**AI-Powered Tools (2026 Update):**

| Tool | Function | AI Features |
|------|----------|-------------|
| axe DevTools | Automated testing | AI suggestions, issue prioritization |
| Deque/Axe | Enterprise scanning | Intelligent false-positive reduction |
| Accessibility Insights | Microsoft's testing suite | Code fix recommendations |
| WAVE | Browser extension | Visual feedback |
| Lighthouse | Chrome DevTools built-in | Performance + a11y scoring |
| Stark | Design plugin | Contrast checking, vision simulation |
| UserWay | Widget + scanner | AI remediation suggestions |
| Equidox | PDF accessibility | Automated tagging |
| Level Access | Enterprise platform | Ask Level AI chatbot |
| 3Play Media | Video accessibility | AI-enabled captions, audio description |

**New AI Capabilities (2026):**
- AI tools attached directly to individual audit issues
- Developers can simplify technical WCAG language
- Get specific code fixes without switching context
- Automated VPAT generation (draft in seconds)
- Intelligent scan reducing false positives

**Caution on Overlays:**
> AI overlays don't fix underlying code issues. They're band-aids, not solutions. Focus on building accessible from the start.

**Best Practice:**
```
1. Automated scan (catch low-hanging fruit)
2. AI suggestions for fixes
3. Manual verification
4. User testing with people with disabilities
5. Continuous monitoring
```

**Key Insight:** "AI is a force multiplier for accessibility programs. By combining automation with human expertise, organizations can scale faster, reduce manual effort, and demonstrate ROI."
