# M-UX-010: Help and Documentation

## Metadata
- **Category:** UX / Nielsen Norman Heuristic #10
- **Difficulty:** Beginner
- **Tags:** #methodology #ux #heuristics #nielsen-norman #help
- **Agent:** faion-usability-agent

## Problem

Users get stuck and cannot find help. Documentation exists but is hard to find. Help content is outdated or too technical. Users must leave the interface to find answers. Help does not address what users actually struggle with.

Without effective help:
- Users give up
- Increased support costs
- Frustrated customers
- Poor adoption

---

## The Heuristic

**Nielsen Norman Heuristic #10:** Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

---

## Framework

### Help Hierarchy

```
1. Interface design (no help needed - best)
2. Inline help (contextual hints)
3. Tooltips (hover information)
4. Guided tours (onboarding)
5. FAQs (common questions)
6. Documentation (detailed reference)
7. Support (human assistance - last resort)
```

### Help Principles

1. **Contextual** - Help where the user needs it
2. **Task-focused** - Organized by user goals
3. **Searchable** - Easy to find answers
4. **Concise** - Brief and to the point
5. **Current** - Kept up to date

---

## Implementation Patterns

### Inline Help

**Field hints:**
```
Label: Password
Hint: Use 8+ characters with letters and numbers
[Password field]
```

**Placeholder text:**
```
[Search products, categories, or brands]
```

### Tooltips

**Icon tooltips:**
```
[?] hover → "This setting controls notification frequency"
```

**Feature explanation:**
```
[i] hover → Brief explanation of feature
```

### Contextual Help Panels

**Sidebar help:**
```
Page-specific help in collapsible sidebar
Shows relevant information for current task
```

### Guided Tours

**Onboarding tour:**
```
Step 1: "This is your dashboard"
Step 2: "Click here to create new project"
Step 3: "Invite team members here"
[Skip] [Next]
```

### Knowledge Base

**Searchable documentation:**
```
Search: "how to reset password"
Results: Password reset instructions
Categories: Account, Security, Getting Started
```

### FAQs

**Common questions:**
```
Q: How do I change my email address?
A: Go to Settings → Account → Email → [Change Email]
