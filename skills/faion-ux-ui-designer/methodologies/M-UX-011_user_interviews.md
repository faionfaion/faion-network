## Problem

You are designing without understanding users. You assume you know what users want. Decisions are based on opinions rather than insights. Features are built that users do not need. The gap between design and reality creates frustration.

Without user interviews:
- Assumptions replace understanding
- Wrong problems solved
- Poor user satisfaction
- Wasted development effort

---

## Framework

### What are User Interviews?

User interviews are one-on-one conversations with users or potential users to understand their needs, behaviors, motivations, and pain points.

### When to Conduct Interviews

| Project Phase | Interview Focus |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Discovery** | Understand problems and needs |
| **Design** | Validate concepts and ideas |
| **Development** | Gather feedback on progress |
| **Post-launch** | Understand usage and issues |

### Interview Types

| Type | Purpose | Duration |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Exploratory** | Understand problem space | 45-60 min |
| **Generative** | Generate ideas | 30-45 min |
| **Evaluative** | Test concepts/designs | 30-45 min |
| **Contextual** | Observe in environment | 60-90 min |

```
"Tell me about the last time you [did X]."
"Walk me through your typical process for [task]."
"What was the most frustrating part?"
```

**Probing:**
```
"Why do you think that happened?"

```

### Bad Interview Questions

**Leading:**
```
Bad: "Don't you think the app is too complicated?"
Good: "How would you describe your experience with the app?"
```

**Closed:**
```
Bad: "Do you like feature X?"
Good: "Tell me about your experience with feature X."
```

**Hypothetical:**
```
Bad: "Would you use a feature that does Y?"
Good: "When have you needed to do something like Y?"
```
