# M-UX-064: VUI Testing Best Practices

### Problem

Voice interfaces are hard to test in controlled environments.

### Solution: Real-World VUI Testing

**Testing Layers:**

| Layer | Method |
|-------|--------|
| Unit | Intent recognition accuracy |
| Integration | Dialog flow completion |
| User | Real-world usability testing |
| Stress | High noise, interruptions |
| Accessibility | Diverse user testing |

**Real-World Testing Checklist:**
```
→ Background noise (TV, traffic, conversation)
→ Different accents and speech patterns
→ Interruptions mid-conversation
→ Multi-user scenarios
→ Edge cases and error recovery
→ Long conversations (context retention)
```

**Metrics:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Intent accuracy | Correct intent detection % |
| Task completion | Users completing goals % |
| Error rate | Failures per conversation |
| Time to complete | Efficiency metric |
| User satisfaction | Post-interaction survey |
