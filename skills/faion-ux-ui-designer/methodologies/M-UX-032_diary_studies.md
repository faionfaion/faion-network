# M-UX-032: Diary Studies

## Metadata

## Problem

Lab studies capture only a moment. Real usage happens over days and weeks. Context and environment matter but you can't observe constantly. Behavior changes over time as users learn. Memory fades, so retrospective interviews miss details. You need to understand habit formation and long-term experience.

Without diary studies:
- Only snapshot understanding
- Missing real-world context
- Unknown behavior evolution
- Lost in-the-moment insights

---

## Framework

### What is a Diary Study?

A diary study is a longitudinal research method where participants record their experiences, behaviors, and thoughts in the moment or shortly after, over an extended period.

### Diary Study Types

| Type | Frequency | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Interval-contingent** | Fixed times (daily, weekly) | Routine behaviors |
| **Event-contingent** | When event occurs | Specific interactions |
| **Signal-contingent** | Prompted randomly | Capture natural moments |

### When to Use

| Good for | Not good for |
|----------|--------------|
| Understanding context | Quick insights |
| Behavior over time | Immediate feedback |
| Habit formation | Rare events |
| Experience evolution | Usability details |
| Real-world patterns | Controlled comparisons |

---

## Process

### Step 1: Define Research Questions

**What to ask:**
- How do behaviors change over time?
- What triggers product usage?
- How does context affect experience?
- What's the journey from novice to expert?

### Step 2: Design the Study

**Key decisions:**

| Decision | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **Duration** | Days, weeks, months |
| **Frequency** | Daily, event-based, random |
| **Format** | App, SMS, email, paper |
| **Entry format** | Text, photo, video, rating |
| **Questions** | Structured or open |

### Step 3: Create Entry Template

Design what participants will record:

```
For each entry:
- When: Date and time
- Where: Location/context
- What: What happened
- How: How they felt
- Why: Their interpretation
```

### Step 4: Recruit and Onboard

**Participant selection:**
- Representative of target users
- Committed for full duration
- Comfortable with self-documentation
- Access to capture method

**Onboarding:**
- Explain purpose and process
- Train on capture method
- Set expectations
- Test understanding

### Step 5: Monitor and Engage

During the study:
- Check completion rates
- Send reminders
- Answer questions
- Provide encouragement
- Monitor data quality

### Step 6: Analyze

**Analysis approaches:**
- Thematic analysis across entries
- Timeline analysis per participant
- Pattern identification
- Quote extraction
- Quantitative trends

### Step 7: Follow-Up Interviews

After diary period:
- Clarify unclear entries
- Explore patterns noticed
- Gather overall reflections
- Fill in gaps

## Examples

### Example 1: New User Onboarding

**Study:** 14-day diary of new app users
**Question:** How does understanding evolve?

**Entry prompt (daily):**
- What did you do with the app today?
- Anything confusing?
- Anything you discovered?
- How confident do you feel using it? (1-5)

**Finding:**
- Days 1-3: Focus on core features, confusion about navigation
- Days 4-7: Discovery of secondary features, "aha moments"
- Days 8-14: Established patterns, some features never used

**Insight:** Users form habits by day 7. Unused features by day 14 likely never adopted.

### Example 2: Multi-Device Usage

**Study:** 30-day diary of cross-device behavior
**Question:** When/why do users switch devices?

**Entry prompt (event-contingent):**
- What device did you use?
- Why this device and not another?
- What were you trying to do?
- Screenshot if possible

**Finding:**
- Morning: Phone (quick checks)
- Work hours: Desktop (complex tasks)
- Evening: Tablet (browsing, reading)
- Switching triggered by task complexity and location

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too long** - Participant fatigue after 2-3 weeks
2. **Too many questions** - Each entry should take <5 minutes
3. **No reminders** - Participants forget without prompts
4. **No engagement** - Participants feel isolated
5. **Delayed analysis** - Losing context by waiting too long
6. **No follow-up** - Missing chance to clarify entries

---

## Participant Engagement

### Keeping Participation High

```
Strategies:
- Personal onboarding call
- Regular encouragement
- Respond to entries (within reason)
- Gamification elements
- Milestone incentives
- Clear end date
```

### Handling Drop-Off

```
Prevention:
- Set realistic expectations
- Screen for commitment
- Make entries quick and easy
- Provide incentive milestones

Recovery:
- Check in personally
- Understand barriers
- Adjust if possible
- Partial incentive for partial completion
```

---

## Quality Assurance

### Entry Quality Checks

| Issue | Detection | Response |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Generic entries** | Same text, low detail | Prompt for specifics |
| **Missed days** | Gap in submissions | Gentle reminder |
| **Copy-paste** | Identical entries | Follow-up call |
| **Off-topic** | Unrelated content | Clarify scope |

### Validity Considerations

```
Potential biases:
- Social desirability (reporting what seems "right")
- Memory reconstruction (not truly in-the-moment)
- Observation effect (behavior changes when studied)
- Fatigue effects (declining quality over time)

Mitigation:
- Emphasize honesty
- Use signal-contingent prompts
- Keep study duration reasonable
- Monitor and discuss in follow-up
```

## Analysis Tips

### Organizing Data

```
Structure:
1. By participant (individual journey)
2. By time (patterns over study)
3. By theme (cross-participant patterns)
4. By question (specific responses)
```

### Timeline Visualization

```
Day:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
P1:     +  +  +  -  -  +  +  +  +  +
P2:     +  +  -  -  +  +  +  +  +  +
P3:     +  -  -  -  -  X  X  X  X  X

+ = positive experience
- = negative experience
X = no entry

Pattern: Day 3-5 common frustration point
```
