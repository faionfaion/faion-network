# AI + Spatial Computing

### Problem

Spatial interfaces generate complex contextual data.

### Solution: AI-Powered Spatial UX

**AI Capabilities:**

| Capability | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| Scene understanding | Auto-adapt UI to environment |
| Object recognition | Contextual information |
| Gesture prediction | Anticipate user intent |
| Voice integration | Natural commands |
| Personalization | Learn user preferences |

**AI-Enhanced Patterns:**
```
Contextual awareness:
→ AI detects room type
→ UI adapts accordingly
→ Suggestions based on context

Predictive UI:
→ AI anticipates needs
→ Pre-positions relevant content
→ Reduces interaction friction
```

**Convergence of AI + XR:**
> "Major technology companies are investing heavily in this convergence, recognizing that spatial computing combined with generative AI will create completely new categories of user experiences."
