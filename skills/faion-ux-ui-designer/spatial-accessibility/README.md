# Spatial Accessibility

### Problem

Spatial interfaces introduce new accessibility challenges.

### Solution: Inclusive Spatial Design

**Accessibility Considerations:**

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Motor limitations | Gaze, voice alternatives |
| Visual impairment | Audio cues, haptics |
| Cognitive load | Simplified modes |
| Physical space | Seated alternatives |
| Motion sensitivity | Comfort settings |

**Implementation:**
```
→ Multiple input modalities
→ Adjustable comfort settings
→ Caption spatial audio
→ Provide non-spatial alternatives
→ Test with diverse users
```

**Seated Mode:**
```
→ Reposition UI to seated height
→ Reduce movement requirements
→ Allow teleportation only
→ Adjust interaction zones
```

## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|
| Accessibility audit | haiku | Systematic check: verifying WCAG compliance criteria |
