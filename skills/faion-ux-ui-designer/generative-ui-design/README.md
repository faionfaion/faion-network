# Generative UI Design

## Problem

Manual UI creation is time-consuming. Teams need faster ideation cycles.

## Generative UI Tools

| Tool | Specialization | Output Quality |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Galileo | UI generation | Production-ready |
| Uizard | Wireframe-to-design | Rapid prototypes |
| v0 (Vercel) | React component generation | Code output |
| Claude Artifacts | Interactive prototypes | Code + preview |
| Relume | Wireframe generation | Figma-ready |

## AI Design Workflow

```
Ideation        → AI generates options
Selection       → Human curates best
Refinement      → AI + human iteration
Brand alignment → Human verification
Implementation  → AI-assisted coding
```

## Quality Considerations

- AI outputs are starting points, not finals
- Brand consistency requires human oversight
- Accessibility must be manually verified
- Edge cases need human attention

## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|
| Design token implementation | haiku | Pattern application: applying design tokens to components |
