# Cognitive Inclusion Design

### Problem

Traditional accessibility focuses on visual/motor impairments. Cognitive disabilities (ADHD, autism, dyslexia) often overlooked.

### Solution: Design for Cognitive Inclusion

**Cognitive Load Reduction:**

| Aspect | Best Practice |
|--------|---------------|
| Information structure | Clear hierarchy, chunked content |
| Notifications | Non-intrusive, user-controllable |
| Navigation | Predictable, consistent patterns |
| Reading | Dyslexia-friendly fonts, line spacing |
| Focus | Distraction-free modes available |
| Time limits | Extended or eliminated |
| Error messages | Clear, non-blaming, actionable |

**ADHD-Friendly Design:**
- Progress indicators for multi-step tasks
- Auto-save functionality
- Bookmark/resume capabilities
- Reduced motion options
- Focus modes

**Autism-Friendly Design:**
- Predictable interactions
- Clear visual boundaries
- Literal language (no idioms)
- Sensory-friendly color palettes
- Transition warnings

**Dyslexia-Friendly Design:**
- OpenDyslexic or similar fonts option
- Adequate line height (1.5+)
- Left-aligned text (no justification)
- High contrast modes
- Text-to-speech integration

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Multiple ways to access information
- [ ] Adjustable text size/spacing
- [ ] Customizable color schemes
- [ ] Reducible cognitive load options
- [ ] Clear feedback on all actions
