# AI-Enhanced Design Systems

### Problem

Scaling design systems requires significant manual effort.

### Solution: AI Integration

**AI Capabilities:**

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Component generation | AI generates variations |
| Documentation | Auto-generate component docs |
| Pattern recognition | Identify inconsistencies |
| Token suggestions | Recommend token values |
| Usage analytics | Track adoption patterns |

**AI Amplification Principle:**
> "AI will not magically correct deficiencies within a design system. It will amplify and extend the foundational structures provided."

**Prerequisites for AI Success:**
```
Solid foundation:
→ Well-defined tokens
→ Systematic component structure
→ Clear naming conventions
→ Documented relationships

Then AI can:
→ Scale out variations
→ Generate documentation
→ Suggest improvements
→ Identify patterns
```

## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|
| Design token implementation | haiku | Pattern application: applying design tokens to components |
