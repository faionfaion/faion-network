# VUI Privacy and Security

### Problem

Voice data is sensitive and persistent.

### Solution: Privacy-First VUI Design

**Privacy Principles:**

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Transparency | Clear data collection disclosure |
| Control | Easy privacy settings |
| Minimization | Collect only needed data |
| Security | Encrypted storage/transmission |
| Deletion | User can delete voice history |

**Trust Indicators:**
```
→ Visual indicator when listening
→ Audio confirmation of processing
→ Clear "stop listening" command
→ Voice history access
→ Opt-out options
```

**Sensitive Operations:**
```
For banking, health, personal info:
→ Require additional authentication
→ Mask spoken sensitive data
→ Confirm before actions
→ Offer private mode
```
