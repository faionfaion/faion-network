# MLP Planning Reference

## MVP Scope Definition

**Key Principle:** Analyze competitors to define what's truly minimum.

```
Features in ALL competitors (100%) = Table Stakes = MVP Must-Have
Features in MOST competitors (70%+) = Expected = MVP Should-Have
Features in SOME competitors (<50%) = Differentiators = MLP Candidates
Features in NO competitors (0%) = Innovation = WOW Potential
```

**Process:**
1. Identify 5-7 top competitors with same core feature
2. Extract feature lists from each
3. Build intersection matrix
4. Table stakes = features ALL have (users expect these)
5. Everything else = opportunity to differentiate

## MLP Triad

Every MLP must excel at three things:

1. **Functionality** — Core job works reliably
2. **Usability** — Easy to use without training
3. **Delight** — Exceeds expectations, creates WOW

Miss any one → not MLP.

## MVP vs MLP Comparison

| Aspect | MVP | MLP |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Goal | Validate idea works | Make users fall in love |
| Focus | Core functionality | Emotional connection + delight |
| UX Quality | Functional | Polished, delightful |
| User Reaction | "It works" | "This is amazing!" |
| Sharing | Unlikely | Users become advocates |
| Timeline | Fastest | Moderate (worth it) |
| Trust | Assumed | Built through transparency |

## Gap Analysis Template

For each feature, fill:

```markdown
### Feature: [Name]

**Current (MVP):**
- Input: [what user provides]
- Process: [what happens]
- Output: [what user gets]
- UX: [how it feels]

**Target (MLP):**
- Input: [enhanced version]
- Process: [transparent, faster]
- Output: [richer, branded]
- UX: [delightful, WOW]

**Gaps:**
1. Gap 1 — Severity: High
2. Gap 2 — Severity: Medium

**MLP Requirements:**
- FR-XX.Y: Requirement 1
- FR-XX.Z: Requirement 2
```

## Implementation Phase Template

```markdown
### Phase N: [Phase Name] (Week X-Y)

**WOW Moment:** "[User quote when they see this]"

**Features:**
- feature-1: Description
- feature-2: Description

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

**Dependencies:**
- Requires Phase N-1 complete
- Requires [resource/data]
```

## MLP Success Metrics

Common metrics that improve with MLP:

| Metric | MVP Baseline | MLP Target | Why Higher |
|--------|--------------|------------|------------|
| Activation rate | 35% | 50%+ | Delight drives completion |
| Time to value | 10 min | 3 min | Smart defaults |
| NPS | 30 | 50+ | Love, not satisfaction |
| Referral rate | 0.5/user | 1.5/user | WOW = sharing |
| Free→Paid | 10% | 20% | Perceived value higher |
| Churn | 8%/mo | 4%/mo | Harder to leave |

## User Research for MLP

MLP requires user input. Minimum validation:

**Before Building:**
- Interview 5+ target users
- Understand current pain (what do they hate?)
- Identify delight opportunities (what would surprise them?)

**Key Questions:**
1. "Walk me through how you do [task] today"
2. "What's the most frustrating part?"
3. "If this worked perfectly, what would happen?"
4. "Would you tell a colleague about this?" (NPS proxy)

**After First Version:**
- Can user complete core task without help?
- What word describes the experience?
- What would make them switch from current solution?

## When to Use MLP vs MVP

**Choose MVP when:**
- Validating completely new market
- Very limited resources
- Speed to market critical
- High uncertainty about problem

**Choose MLP when:**
- Competitive market exists
- Word-of-mouth is key channel
- Premium pricing intended
- Trust is critical (safety, finance, health)
- Need advocates, not just users

## Investment Balance

MLP requires careful resource allocation:

| Level | Description | Risk |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Under-invested | Basic MVP with no polish | Forgettable, no word-of-mouth |
| Over-invested | Feature creep, perfectionism | Delayed launch, wasted resources |
| Sweet spot | Core function + 2-3 WOW moments | Ship fast, iterate on feedback |

**Decision Framework:**
- If feature doesn't enable core job → CUT
- If feature doesn't create WOW → DEFER
- If feature blocks launch → SIMPLIFY

**Quote:** "A lovable product is one that users love, not one that has every feature." — Brian de Haaff

## Onboarding Excellence

Critical touchpoint for MLP. Check:

| Element | MVP | MLP |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Steps to value | 5+ steps | ≤3 steps |
| Time to first WOW | 5+ minutes | <60 seconds |
| Help needed | Yes, read docs | No, intuitive |
| Error recovery | Generic messages | Helpful guidance |
| Progress visibility | None | Clear indicators |

**Onboarding Checklist:**
- [ ] User sees value before signup required
- [ ] First action takes <10 seconds
- [ ] Success is celebrated visually
- [ ] Mistakes are easy to undo
- [ ] Help is contextual, not hidden

---

## Common MLP Anti-Patterns

**DON'T:**
- Add features without WOW analysis
- Skip trust elements in AI products
- Ignore mobile experience
- Assume users will tolerate friction
- Launch without offline consideration
- Forget about professional output quality
- Skip user research ("we know what they want")
- Over-engineer before validation

**DO:**
- Define WOW moments before coding
- Build trust through transparency
- Prioritize mobile-first for field use
- Remove friction aggressively
- Test offline scenarios early
- Make output users are proud to share
- Talk to 5+ users before finalizing specs
- Ship smallest lovable version first

## Competitive Analysis for MLP

Quick scan framework:

| Competitor | Onboarding | Trust Signals | Delight | Professional Output |
|------------|------------|---------------|---------|---------------------|
| Competitor A | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Competitor B | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Our target | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**Questions to answer:**
1. What do competitors do well? (Copy shamelessly)
2. Where are they weak? (Opportunity)
3. What's table stakes? (Must have)
4. What would differentiate us? (WOW focus)

## Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

**MLP = Functionality + Usability + Delight**

**4 Principles:**
1. Instant Gratification (<60 sec to value)
2. Professional Quality (better than DIY)
3. Zero Friction (obvious flow)
4. Surprising Delight (exceed expectations)

**Gap Severity:**
- Critical: Blocks MLP status
- High: Major gap, fix before launch
- Medium: Nice to have
- Low: Future iteration

**WOW Formula:**
```
WOW Score = (Delight × Impact) / Effort
Prioritize: High WOW, Low Effort
```

**Success Signal:**
> "Where can I buy this?" — before demo ends
