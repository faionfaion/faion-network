## Problem

Poor quality leads to:
- Rework consuming 20-40% of project time
- Customer dissatisfaction and churn
- Technical debt accumulating
- Team morale declining from constant firefighting

## Framework

### Quality Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Quality** | Degree to which requirements are met |
| **Grade** | Category/rank of features (premium vs basic) |
| **Prevention** | Building quality in (better than detection) |
| **Detection** | Finding defects (testing, reviews) |

### Three Quality Processes

```
Plan Quality → Manage Quality → Control Quality
     ↓              ↓                ↓
  Standards     Processes         Verification
```

### Step 1: Plan Quality

Define quality standards before work begins:

**Quality Metrics:**
| Type | Example Metrics |
|------|-----------------|
| **Product** | Performance, reliability, usability |
| **Process** | Defect rate, code coverage, review completion |
| **Perception** | Customer satisfaction, NPS |

### Step 2: Manage Quality (Assurance)

Ensure processes produce quality:

**Quality Assurance Activities:**
- Code review standards
- Definition of Done
- Automated testing requirements
- Documentation standards
- Regular audits/retrospectives

### Step 3: Control Quality

Verify deliverables meet standards:

**Quality Control Activities:**
- Testing (unit, integration, UAT)
- Inspections and reviews
- Checklists verification
- Defect tracking and resolution

## Common Mistakes

1. **Quality as afterthought** - Build it in, don't test it in
2. **Skipping code reviews** - "We're in a hurry" creates technical debt
3. **No Definition of Done** - "Done" means different things to different people
4. **Ignoring minor bugs** - They accumulate into major problems
5. **Not measuring quality** - What gets measured gets managed
