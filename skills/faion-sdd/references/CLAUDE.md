## Detailed File Descriptions

### best-practices-2026.md

Research compilation covering 5 additional methodologies based on industry best practices:

| Methodology | Topic | Key Focus |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| M-SDD-013 | AI-Assisted Specification Writing | Using LLMs for spec generation, human-AI collaboration workflow, tools (AWS Kiro, Claude Code, Cursor) |
| M-SDD-014 | Living Documentation (Docs-as-Code) | Treating docs like code, CI/CD integration, auto-generation, LLM-optimized docs |
| M-SDD-015 | Architecture Decision Records (ADR) | Nygard format, ADR lifecycle, status types, co-location with code |
| M-SDD-016 | API-First Development | OpenAPI 3.1, contract testing, mock servers, SDK generation |
| M-SDD-017 | Design Docs Patterns (Big Tech) | Google Design Docs, Uber ERD/RFC, Amazon 6-pager approaches |

### Sources

Research drawn from:

- **Thoughtworks** - SDD engineering practices
- **Martin Fowler** - SDD tools analysis
- **AWS** - ADR best practices
- **Google Cloud** - Architecture documentation
- **Microsoft** - Spec-driven development, Azure ADR
- **Red Hat** - AI coding quality
- **Pragmatic Engineer** - RFCs and design docs

### Key Trends 2025-2026

1. **AI as specification partner** - LLMs help structure specs, humans remain accountable
2. **Bottleneck shift** - Implementation commoditized, specification skills premium
3. **Docs-as-Code mainstream** - Version control and CI/CD for documentation
4. **ADRs standard practice** - Adopted across AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft
5. **API-First mandatory** - Design before implementation with OpenAPI 3.1
6. **Contract testing** - Automated verification against spec
