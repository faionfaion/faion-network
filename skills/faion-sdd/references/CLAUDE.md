## Detailed File Descriptions

### ai-assisted-specification-writing.md

AI-assisted specification writing methodology:
- SDD-AI workflow: Intent -> Spec -> Plan -> Execution -> Review
- Human-AI collaboration process
- Tools: AWS Kiro, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf
- Templates for spec generation and review

### living-documentation-docs-as-code.md

Living documentation (Docs-as-Code) approach:
- Docs-as-Code principles
- CI/CD pipeline for documentation
- LLM-ready documentation structure
- Tools: Doxygen, Sphinx, Mintlify, GitBook

### architecture-decision-records.md

Architecture Decision Records (ADR):
- Nygard format structure
- ADR lifecycle and status types
- Templates for ADR and review meetings
- Best practices for co-location with code

### api-first-development.md

API-First development approach:
- API-First principles and workflow
- OpenAPI 3.1 specification template
- CI/CD pipeline for contract testing
- Tools: Spectral, Prism, Pact, Dredd

### design-docs-patterns-big-tech.md

Design document patterns from Big Tech:
- Google Design Doc template
- Uber RFC/ERD template
- Amazon 6-pager approach
- Best practices for silent reading and reviews

### key-trends-summary.md

Summary of key trends 2025-2026:
- SDD trends: AI as specification partner, bottleneck shift

## Sources

Research drawn from:

- **Thoughtworks** - SDD engineering practices
- **Martin Fowler** - SDD tools analysis
- **AWS** - ADR best practices
- **Google Cloud** - Architecture documentation
- **Microsoft** - Spec-driven development, Azure ADR
- **Red Hat** - AI coding quality
- **Pragmatic Engineer** - RFCs and design docs

- **JetBrains** - Spec-driven approach for AI

## Key Trends 2025-2026

1. **AI as specification partner** - LLMs help structure specs, humans remain accountable
2. **Bottleneck shift** - Implementation commoditized, specification skills premium
3. **Docs-as-Code mainstream** - Version control and CI/CD for documentation
4. **ADRs standard practice** - Adopted across AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft
5. **API-First mandatory** - Design before implementation with OpenAPI 3.1
6. **Contract testing** - Automated verification against spec
