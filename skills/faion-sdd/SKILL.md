# SDD Domain Skill

**Communication: User's language. Docs/code: English.**

## Philosophy

**"Intent is the source of truth"** - specification is the main artifact, code is just its implementation.

**No Time Estimates:** Use complexity levels (Low/Medium/High) and token estimates (~Xk) instead.

## Workflow Overview

```
CONSTITUTION -> SPEC -> DESIGN -> IMPL-PLAN -> TASKS -> EXECUTE -> DONE
      |          |        |          |           |         |        |
   project    feature  technical   100k rule   atomic    agent    learn
   principles  intent   approach   compliance   units   execution reflect
```

## Decision Tree: What to Do?

### Starting a Project

```
Is this a new project?
  |
  +-- YES: Does codebase exist?
  |         |-- YES -> Section 1 (MODE 1: Analyze codebase)
  |         |-- NO  -> Section 1 (MODE 2: Socratic dialogue)
  |
  +-- NO: Working on existing project
          |
          Does constitution.md exist?
            |-- NO  -> Section 1 first
            |-- YES -> Continue below
```

### Starting a Feature

```
Feature in backlog?
  |
  +-- NO: Add new feature
  |       -> Section 9: Backlog Grooming
  |
  +-- YES: Check document status
          |
          spec.md exists and approved?
            |-- NO  -> Section 2: Writing Specifications
            |-- YES -> design.md exists and approved?
                        |-- NO  -> Section 3: Design Documents
                        |-- YES -> implementation-plan.md exists?
                                    |-- NO  -> Section 4: Implementation Plans
                                    |-- YES -> tasks created?
                                                |-- NO  -> Section 5: Task Creation
                                                |-- YES -> Section 6 or 7: Execute
```

### Executing Tasks

```
How many tasks to execute?
  |
  +-- Single task -> Section 6: Task Execution
  |
  +-- All tasks -> Need parallel optimization?
                    |-- NO  -> Section 7: Batch Execution
                    |-- YES -> Section 8: Parallelization first
                               then Section 7
```

### Quality & Learning

```
What phase?
  |
  +-- Before spec    -> Section 12 (Pre-Spec confidence)
  +-- Before design  -> Section 12 (Pre-Design confidence)
  +-- Before tasks   -> Section 12 (Pre-Task confidence)
  +-- Before code    -> Section 12 (Pre-Implementation confidence)
  |
  +-- After task     -> Section 13 (Reflexion)
  +-- Code review    -> Section 11 (Quality Gates - Code)
  +-- SDD review     -> Section 11 (Quality Gates - SDD)
```

```

**Lifecycle:** `backlog/ -> todo/ -> in-progress/ -> done/`

## 100k Token Rule

Each task MUST fit within 100k token context:

```
Research:       ~20k (read existing code)
Task file:       ~5k
Implementation: ~50k
Buffer:         ~25k
TOTAL:         <100k
```

**Token Estimation:**

| Component | Tokens |
|-----------|--------|
| Django model (simple) | 5-10k |
| Django model (complex) | 15-25k |
| Service class | 20-40k |
| ViewSet | 15-30k |
| Test file | 20-40k |

**Rule:** If uncertain, estimate higher and split.

---

## Confidence Thresholds

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| >=90% | Proceed confidently |
| 70-89% | Present alternatives, clarify gaps |
| <70% | Stop, ask questions first |

**ROI:** 100-200 tokens checking saves 5-50K tokens of wrong-direction work.

---

## Quality Gate Levels

| Level | Check | Pass Criteria |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| L1 | Syntax | Linting zero errors |
| L2 | Types | Type checking zero errors |
| L3 | Tests | Unit tests 100% pass |
| L4 | Integration | Integration tests 100% pass |
| L5 | Review | Code review approved |
| L6 | Acceptance | All AC criteria met |
