## Problem

Projects fail when teams build the wrong thing. This happens because:
- Requirements are vague or missing
- Stakeholders have different expectations
- Scope keeps changing during development
- No single source of truth for "what are we building?"
- User needs not properly researched
- Acceptance criteria not testable

**The root cause:** No written specification that everyone agrees on.

---

## Framework

### What is a Specification?

A specification (spec) answers: **"WHAT are we building and WHY?"**

It does NOT answer "how" - that's for the design document.

### Spec vs Design vs Implementation Plan

| Document | Question | Output |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Specification | WHAT and WHY? | Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria |
| Design | HOW? | Architecture, file structure, API contracts |
| Implementation Plan | IN WHAT ORDER? | Tasks, dependencies, estimates |

### Spec Structure v2.0

```markdown
# Feature: [Name]

## Reference Documents
[Links to constitution, related specs]

## Overview
[1-2 paragraphs explaining what this feature does]

## Problem Statement
[Who, what problem, why it matters, business value]

## User Personas
[Who are the users]

## User Stories (User Story Mapping)
[Backbone → Walking Skeleton → Full Product]

## Use Cases (if complex)
[Actor, preconditions, flow, alternatives]

## Functional Requirements
[FR-X with SMART criteria, MoSCoW priority]

## Non-Functional Requirements
[NFR-X: performance, security, scalability]

## Acceptance Criteria (BDD)
[Given-When-Then format]

## Out of Scope
[Explicit exclusions]

## Assumptions & Constraints
[What we assume, limitations]

## Related Features
[Feature dependencies, related specs]

## Recommended Skills & Methodologies
[For implementation phase]
```

---

## Writing Process

### Phase 1: Load Context

Before writing, read and understand:

```
1. aidocs/sdd/{PROJECT}/constitution.md - project principles, tech stack
2. aidocs/sdd/{PROJECT}/features/done/ - completed features (patterns)
3. Related specs in features/todo/ or features/in-progress/
```

Extract:
- Tech stack constraints
- Code standards
- Existing patterns
- Related features to reference

### Phase 2: Problem Analysis (BA: M-BA-004 SMART)

#### 2.1 Define the Problem (SMART)

| Criterion | Question | Bad Example | Good Example |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **S**pecific | Exactly who and what? | "Users need auth" | "New users cannot register" |
| **M**easurable | How to measure success? | "Should be fast" | "Registration < 3 seconds" |
| **A**chievable | Technically feasible? | "AI that reads minds" | "OAuth 2.0 integration" |
| **R**elevant | Ties to business goal? | "Nice to have" | "Blocks monetization" |
| **T**ime-bound | When needed? | "Eventually" | "Required for Q1 launch" |

#### 2.2 Business Value Statement

Format:
```
[WHO] currently cannot [WHAT] because [WHY].
This results in [IMPACT].
By implementing [SOLUTION], we will [BENEFIT].
```

Example:
```
New users currently cannot access premium content because there's no
login system. This results in $0 revenue from premium features.
By implementing email authentication, we will enable premium subscriptions.
```

### Phase 3: User Research (UX: M-UX-017, M-UX-018)

#### 3.1 Define User Personas

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Archetype name |
| **Role** | What they do |
| **Goal** | What they want to achieve |
| **Pain Points** | Current frustrations |
| **Context** | When/where they use the product |

Example:
```markdown
### Persona 1: Freelance Developer "Alex"
- **Role:** Solo developer building SaaS products
- **Goal:** Ship MVPs quickly without server management
- **Pain Points:** Too much time on auth, payments, infra
- **Context:** Works from home, uses macOS, deploys to Vercel
```

### Phase 4: User Story Mapping (BA: M-BA-013, PdM: M-PRD-006)

#### 4.1 Story Mapping Structure

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
                    │             USER ACTIVITIES             │
                    │  (High-level goals: "Manage Account")   │
                    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                        │
                    ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
                    ↓                   ↓                   ↓
            ┌───────────┐       ┌───────────┐       ┌───────────┐

        ┌───────────┼───────┐   ┌───────┼───────┐          │
        ↓           ↓       ↓   ↓       ↓       ↓          ↓
    ┌───────┐ ┌───────┐ ┌───────┐ ┌───────┐ ┌───────┐ ┌───────┐
    │ MVP   │ │ MVP   │ │ v1.1  │ │ MVP   │ │ v1.1  │ │ MVP   │
    │US-001 │ │US-002 │ │US-005 │ │US-003 │ │US-006 │ │US-004 │
    └───────┘ └───────┘ └───────┘ └───────┘ └───────┘ └───────┘

    ─────────── MVP (Walking Skeleton) ───────────────────────
    ─────────── v1.1 (Release 2) ─────────────────────────────
```

#### 4.2 Write User Stories

Format: As a [PERSONA], I want [ACTION], so that [BENEFIT].

**INVEST Criteria for User Stories:**
| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **I**ndependent | Can be delivered separately? |
| **N**egotiable | Details can be discussed? |
| **V**aluable | Delivers user/business value? |
| **E**stimable | Can estimate effort? |
| **S**mall | Fits in one sprint/iteration? |
| **T**estable | Can write acceptance tests? |

Example:
```markdown
### US-001: Email Registration (MVP)
**As a** freelance developer (Alex)
**I want to** create an account with my email
**So that** I can save my API keys and project settings

**Acceptance Criteria:** (see AC-001)
**Priority:** Must (MVP)
**Estimate:** 3 story points
```

### Phase 5: Use Cases (BA: M-BA-012) - For Complex Features

When to use: Multi-step workflows, multiple actors, complex validations.

```markdown
### UC-001: User Registration

**Primary Actor:** Unregistered User
**Preconditions:** User is not logged in, has valid email

**Main Flow:**
1. User navigates to registration page
2. User enters email and password
3. System validates email format
4. System checks email uniqueness
5. System creates account
6. System sends verification email
7. User is redirected to dashboard

**Alternative Flows:**
- 3a. Invalid email format → Show error, return to step 2
- 4a. Email exists → Show "already registered" error

**Postconditions:** Account created, verification email sent
```

### Phase 6: Functional Requirements (BA: M-BA-004, M-BA-005)

#### 6.1 SMART Requirements

Each requirement MUST be:

| Criterion | How to Apply |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Specific** | One interpretation only |
| **Measurable** | Testable with pass/fail |
| **Achievable** | Technically possible |
| **Relevant** | Traces to user story |
| **Time-bound** | Has priority (MoSCoW) |

#### 6.2 Requirements Format

```markdown
### FR-001: Email Registration

**Requirement:** System SHALL allow users to register with email and password.

**Rationale:** Enables user identification for premium features.

**Traces to:** US-001

**Acceptance Criteria:** AC-001, AC-002

**Priority:** Must

**Validation Rules:**
- Email: valid format, unique in system
- Password: min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number
```

#### 6.3 MoSCoW Prioritization (PdM: M-PRD-001)

| Priority | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Must** | MVP requirement, cannot launch without | Login, Core feature |
| **Should** | Important but not critical | Password reset |
| **Could** | Nice to have if time allows | Social login |
| **Won't** | Explicitly not in this release | SSO, 2FA |

### Phase 7: Non-Functional Requirements

#### 7.1 NFR Categories

| Category | What to Specify | Example |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Performance** | Response times, throughput | < 500ms p95 latency |
| **Scalability** | Load capacity | 10k concurrent users |
| **Security** | Auth, encryption, compliance | bcrypt, HTTPS, GDPR |
| **Availability** | Uptime, recovery | 99.9% uptime, 4h RTO |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG level | WCAG 2.1 AA |
| **Usability** | UX metrics | < 3 clicks to complete |

#### 7.2 NFR Format

```markdown
### NFR-001: Login Performance

**Requirement:** Login response time SHALL be < 500ms for p95.

**Measurement:** Server-side response time, excluding network.

**Priority:** Must

**Validation:** Load test with 1000 concurrent users.
```

### Phase 8: Acceptance Criteria (BA: M-BA-014)

#### 8.1 Given-When-Then Format (BDD)

```markdown
### AC-001: Successful Registration

**Scenario:** User registers with valid credentials

**Given:** User is on registration page
**And:** User has valid email not in system
**When:** User enters email "test@example.com" and password "SecurePass1"
**And:** User clicks "Register" button
**Then:** Account is created in database
**And:** User receives verification email within 30 seconds
**And:** User is redirected to dashboard
**And:** Success message "Check your email" is displayed
```

#### 8.2 Coverage Checklist

- [x] Error handling (validation failures)
- [ ] Boundary conditions (min/max values)
- [ ] Security scenarios (injection, auth bypass)
- [ ] Performance scenarios (load, timeout)
