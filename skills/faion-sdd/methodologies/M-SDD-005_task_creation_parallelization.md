## Problem

Implementation plans become bottlenecks when:
- Tasks are executed sequentially when they could run in parallel
- Task granularity is wrong (too big or too small)
- Dependencies are unclear or circular
- Progress is hard to track
- Tasks lack context for AI/human execution
- No traceability to requirements or design decisions

**The root cause:** Poor task decomposition, missing context, and inadequate dependency analysis.

---

## Integrated Best Practices

This methodology integrates principles from:

| Domain | Methodology | Key Principle |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **BA** | M-BA-004 | SMART criteria for requirements |
| **BA** | M-BA-014 | Given-When-Then acceptance criteria |
| **BA** | M-BA-005 | Requirements traceability (FR-X, AD-X links) |
| **PM** | M-PM-003 | WBS decomposition (8-80 rule, 100% rule) |
| **PM** | M-PM-004 | Dependency types (FS, SS, FF, SF) |
| **PdM** | M-PRD-018 | INVEST principle for task quality |
| **SDD** | M-SDD-002 | Spec → Task traceability |
| **SDD** | M-SDD-003 | Design → Task traceability |

---

## Framework

### 1. Task Decomposition Principles

#### 1.1 Right Size (PMBOK 8-80 Rule Adapted)

| Complexity | Effort | Tokens | Description |
|------------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **simple** | 1-2h | <30k | Single file, clear pattern |
| **normal** | 2-3h | 30-60k | Multiple files, some decisions |
| **complex** | 3-4h | 60-100k | Architecture decisions, research needed |

**Maximum:** 4 hours / 100k tokens per task (single work session)

**Too big:** "Implement authentication" (multiple days)
**Too small:** "Add import statement" (minutes)
**Right size:** "Create password hashing utilities" (2-3 hours)

#### 1.2 INVEST Principle (from M-PRD-018)

Each task must be:

| Criterion | Question | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Independent** | Can be done without other tasks? | ✅ Password utils (no deps) |
| **Negotiable** | Details can be refined? | ✅ Algorithm choice negotiable |
| **Valuable** | Clear user/business value? | ✅ "Enables secure login" |
| **Estimable** | Can estimate effort? | ✅ "2-3 hours" |
| **Small** | Fits in 1-4 hours? | ✅ Not "build auth system" |
| **Testable** | Clear acceptance criteria? | ✅ Given-When-Then defined |

#### 1.3 Clear Boundaries

Each task must define:
- **Input:** What exists before (files, data, dependencies)
- **Output:** What exists after (files created/modified, features)
- **Success criteria:** How to verify completion (tests, AC)

#### 1.4 SMART Criteria (from M-BA-004)

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Specific** | Only one interpretation of task |
| **Measurable** | Can verify completion objectively |
| **Achievable** | Technically feasible with given context |
| **Relevant** | Traces to business need (FR-X) |
| **Time-bound** | Effort estimate provided |

### 2. Traceability (from M-BA-005)

Every task must link to:

```
TASK → FR-X (spec.md) → AD-X (design.md)
```

| Link Type | What It Answers |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **FR-X** | WHY this task exists (user need) |
| **AD-X** | HOW to implement (architecture decision) |
| **NFR-X** | Constraints (performance, security) |

**Template:**
```markdown
## Requirements Coverage
### FR-2: User can log in with email/password
Full text of requirement from spec.md

## Architecture Decisions
### AD-1: JWT for authentication
Full text of decision from design.md
```

### 3. Acceptance Criteria (from M-BA-014)

Use Given-When-Then (BDD) format:

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

**AC-1: Successful login**
- Given: registered user with valid credentials
- When: user submits login form
- Then: JWT token returned, user redirected to dashboard

**AC-2: Invalid password**
- Given: registered user with wrong password
- When: user submits login form
- Then: error message "Invalid credentials" displayed
```

**Coverage checklist:**
- [ ] Happy path (success scenario)
- [ ] Alternative paths (valid variations)
- [ ] Boundary conditions (limits, edge cases)
- [ ] Error handling (invalid inputs, failures)
- [ ] Security (unauthorized access)
- [ ] Performance (if NFR applies)

### 4. Dependency Analysis

#### 4.1 Dependency Types (from M-PM-004)

| Type | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **FS** | Finish-to-Start | User model must finish before login handler starts |
| **SS** | Start-to-Start | Frontend and API can start together |
| **FF** | Finish-to-Finish | Tests must finish when code finishes |
| **SF** | Start-to-Finish | Rare, migration starts when old code finishes |

#### 4.2 Create Task Graph

Draw tasks as nodes, dependencies as arrows:

```
TASK-001 (DB Tables)
    ↓ [FS]
TASK-003 (User Model) ────→ TASK-005 (Register Handler)
    ↓ [FS]                        ↓ [FS]
TASK-002 (Password Utils) → TASK-004 (JWT Utils) → TASK-006 (Login Handler)
```

#### 4.3 Identify Parallel Paths

Tasks without arrows between them can run in parallel:

**Can parallelize:**
- TASK-001 (DB) and TASK-002 (Password Utils) - no dependency
- TASK-003 (Model) and TASK-004 (JWT Utils) - both depend on TASK-001

**Cannot parallelize:**
- TASK-005 and TASK-003 - TASK-005 needs TASK-003

#### 4.4 Calculate Critical Path

The longest chain determines minimum time:

```
Path A: TASK-001 → TASK-003 → TASK-005 = 6 hours
Path B: TASK-001 → TASK-004 → TASK-006 = 5 hours
Path C: TASK-002 → TASK-004 → TASK-006 = 4 hours

Critical path: A (6 hours minimum)
```

### 5. Wave-Based Task Creation

**Principle:** Create tasks in waves based on dependency graph, not all at once.

#### 5.1 Why Waves?

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| All tasks at once | Later tasks lack context from completed tasks |
| Sequential creation | Slow, no parallelization |
| **Wave-based** | Balance: create parallel tasks together, incorporate learnings |

#### 5.2 Wave Creation Process

```
1. Analyze dependency graph
2. Identify Wave 1 tasks (no dependencies)
3. Create Wave 1 tasks with full detail
4. Execute Wave 1
5. Update context with learnings
6. Create Wave 2 tasks (depend on Wave 1)
7. Repeat until all tasks created
```

**Example:**
```
Wave 1 Creation: [TASK-001, TASK-002] - both have no dependencies
    ↓ execute
Wave 2 Creation: [TASK-003, TASK-004] - depend on Wave 1
    ↓ execute
Wave 3 Creation: [TASK-005, TASK-006] - depend on Wave 2
```

#### 5.3 Benefits of Wave Creation

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Incremental context** | Later tasks incorporate learnings from earlier waves |
| **Pattern discovery** | Wave 1 establishes patterns used in later waves |
| **Reduced rework** | Don't create tasks that may change after discoveries |
| **Better estimates** | Real effort data improves later estimates |

#### 5.4 When to Create All Tasks at Once

Sometimes all tasks should be created upfront:
- Small feature (< 6 tasks)
- Well-understood domain with clear patterns
- Need full scope estimate for planning
- Team needs parallel assignment immediately

### 6. Context Management (for AI Execution)

#### 6.1 Context Budget

| Phase | Budget | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **SDD Docs** | 15% | constitution, spec, design |
| **Task Tree** | 10% | completed dependency tasks |
| **Research** | 25% | existing code patterns |
| **Implementation** | 40% | actual coding |
| **Testing** | 10% | verification |

**Total:** <100k tokens per task

#### 6.2 Reference Documents with Task Dependency Tree

**CRITICAL:** Each task MUST include the full dependency tree of completed tasks.

```markdown
## SDD References

| Document | Path | Sections |
|----------|------|----------|
| Constitution | `aidocs/sdd/{PROJECT}/constitution.md` | Code standards |
| Spec | `{FEATURE_DIR}/spec.md` | FR-X, FR-Y |
| Design | `{FEATURE_DIR}/design.md` | AD-X, AD-Y |
| Contracts | `aidocs/sdd/{PROJECT}/contracts.md` | (if API) |

## Task Dependency Tree

**This task depends on:**

```
TASK-001 (DB Tables) ─────────────────────┐
    Summary: Created users, sessions tables│
    Files: migrations/001_*.py            │
    Patterns: AlterField for nullable     │
                                          ↓
TASK-003 (User Model) ──────────→ TASK-005 (THIS TASK)
    Summary: User model with validation
    Files: models/user.py
    Patterns: BaseModel, email validator
    Key code:
    ```python
    class User(BaseModel):
        email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    ```
```

| M-DEV-015 | Python Best Practices | Code standards |
| M-DEV-069 | shadcn/ui Components | UI implementation |
| M-OPS-005 | Docker Patterns | Containerization |
```

#### 6.3 Task Tree Content Requirements

For each completed dependency task, include:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Summary** | What was done | "Created User model with email validation" |
| **Files** | What was created/modified | `models/user.py`, `migrations/002_*.py` |
| **Patterns** | Reusable patterns discovered | "BaseModel inheritance", "email validator" |
| **Key code** | Critical code snippets | Class definition, key functions |
| **Decisions** | Implementation decisions made | "Used UUID for PK instead of auto-increment" |

#### 6.4 Why Task Tree is Critical

| Without Task Tree | With Task Tree |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Agent re-discovers patterns | Agent reuses established patterns |
| Inconsistent implementations | Consistent code style |
| Duplicate research effort | Builds on prior work |
| Context wasted on discovery | Context used for implementation |
| May contradict earlier tasks | Aligned with earlier decisions |

### 6. Risk & Blocker Pre-identification

```markdown
## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| API rate limits | Medium | High | Implement retry with backoff |
| Schema migration fails | Low | High | Test on staging first |

## Potential Blockers
- [ ] External API access required (need credentials)
- [ ] Design decision AD-3 unclear (ask PO)
```

### 7. Task States

```
BACKLOG → TODO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE
                      ↓
                  BLOCKED
```

| State | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| BACKLOG | Future work, not prioritized | Grooming needed |
| TODO | Ready to start, deps met | Can pick up |
| IN_PROGRESS | Being worked on | Single assignee |
| BLOCKED | Cannot proceed | Document blocker |
| DONE | Completed, verified | Move to done/ |

## Examples

### Example: Auth Feature Decomposition

**Bad:**
```
TASK-001: Build authentication system (8 hours)
```
Problem: Too vague, can't track, can't parallelize.

**Good:**
```
TASK-001: Create users table migration (1h) - simple
TASK-002: Create sessions table migration (1h) - simple
TASK-003: Implement password hashing (2h) - normal, M-DEV-015
TASK-004: Implement JWT utilities (2h) - normal
TASK-005: Create User model with validation (2h) - normal
TASK-006: Create Session model (1h) - simple
TASK-007: Implement register handler (2h) - normal, FR-1
TASK-008: Implement login handler (2h) - normal, FR-2
TASK-009: Implement logout handler (1h) - simple, FR-3
TASK-010: Implement auth middleware (2h) - normal, AD-1
TASK-011: Write unit tests (2h) - normal, M-DEV-025
TASK-012: Write integration tests (2h) - normal
```

**Parallelization waves:**
```
Wave 1 (Day 1 AM):  [TASK-001, TASK-002, TASK-003, TASK-004]
Wave 2 (Day 1 PM):  [TASK-005, TASK-006]
Wave 3 (Day 2 AM):  [TASK-007, TASK-008]
Wave 4 (Day 2 PM):  [TASK-009, TASK-010]
Wave 5 (Day 3):     [TASK-011, TASK-012]

Result: 22h of work in 2.5 days with proper parallelization
```
