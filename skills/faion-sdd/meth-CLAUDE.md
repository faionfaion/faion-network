# Methodologies Folder

## Overview

Contains 16 SDD (Specification-Driven Development) methodologies covering the complete workflow from project setup to backlog management. Each methodology follows a standard format with metadata, problem statement, framework, templates, examples, and common mistakes.

## Methodology Structure

Each methodology file contains:

1. **Metadata** - ID, category, difficulty, tags, domain skill, agents
2. **Problem** - What issue this methodology addresses
3. **Framework** - Step-by-step process and principles
4. **Templates** - Ready-to-use markdown templates
5. **Examples** - Practical application examples
6. **Common Mistakes** - Pitfalls and fixes
7. **Related Methodologies** - Cross-references
8. **Agent** - Which agent implements this methodology
