## AI-Native Product Development

### Problem

Building products without AI in 2026 is like building without internet in 2006.

### Solution: AI-First Architecture

**AI Integration Layers:**

| Layer | AI Application |
|-------|----------------|
| Research | AI-powered user research, sentiment analysis |
| Design | AI design tools, prototyping |
| Development | Copilots, code generation |
| Testing | AI test generation, bug detection |
| Analytics | Predictive analytics, anomaly detection |
| Support | AI chatbots, ticket routing |

**AI-Native MVP Pattern:**
```
Traditional: Build feature -> Test -> Iterate
AI-Native: Define intent -> AI generates -> Human refines -> Test
```

**Key Considerations:**
- EU AI Act compliance from day one
- Explainability requirements
- Bias testing in product development
- Data privacy safeguards

**Build vs Buy (AI Features):**
| Build | Buy/Use API |
|-------|-------------|
| Core differentiator | Commodity AI features |
| Unique data advantage | Standard use cases |
| Long-term moat | Speed to market |
