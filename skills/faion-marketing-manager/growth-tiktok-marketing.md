## Problem

TikTok has 1.5B+ monthly active users and the highest organic reach of any social platform. But most B2B founders and SaaS marketers dismiss it as "just for Gen Z dancing." Meanwhile, competitors are getting millions of views and acquiring customers at near-zero CAC.

The platform rewards creativity, authenticity, and trend awareness. Most businesses fail because they post corporate content that doesn't fit the platform's native style.

---

## Framework

TikTok growth follows a different pattern than other platforms:

```
HOOK      -> Capture attention in first 1-3 seconds
RETAIN    -> Keep viewers watching till the end
CONVERT   -> Turn viewers into followers/customers
COMPOUND  -> Let algorithm amplify your best content
```

### Step 1: Account Setup for Business

**Profile optimization:**

| Element | Best Practice | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Username** | Simple, memorable, searchable | @yourproduct, @foundername |
| **Display name** | Include keyword | "SaaS Tips | Mike" |
| **Bio** | Hook + what you do + CTA | "I help devs launch products | Follow for 0→1 tips" |
| **Link** | Linktree or landing page | One link only (until 1K followers) |

**Account type:**
- Start as Creator account (better algorithm)
- Switch to Business for analytics (after establishing)
- Creator Fund requires 10K followers + 100K views

### Step 2: Content Strategy

**TikTok content pillars for B2B/SaaS:**

| Pillar | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Educational** | Quick tips, how-tos | "3 VS Code shortcuts you need" |
| **Behind the scenes** | Build in public | "Day 47 of building my startup" |
| **Trends with twist** | Use trends for your niche | Trending sound + product demo |
| **Storytelling** | Founder journey | "How I got my first 100 users" |
| **Myth busting** | Challenge assumptions | "Why your landing page sucks" |

**Video formats that work:**

| Format | Duration | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Quick tips** | 15-30 sec | Educational content |
| **Story time** | 60-90 sec | Journey, lessons learned |
| **Tutorial** | 60-180 sec | How-to content |
| **POV/Skit** | 15-30 sec | Relatable humor |
| **Before/After** | 30-60 sec | Transformations, results |

### Step 3: Hook Mastery

**The first 1-3 seconds determine everything.**

**Hook formulas:**

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Curiosity** | "Here's why [unexpected thing]..." | "Here's why your startup will fail..." |
| **Challenge** | "Stop doing [common thing]" | "Stop using Google Docs for specs" |
| **Promise** | "How I [achieved result]" | "How I got 10K users with $0 ads" |
| **Relatability** | "POV: You're a [role] and..." | "POV: You're a founder and..." |
| **Controversy** | "Unpopular opinion: [take]" | "Unpopular opinion: MVP is dead" |

**Visual hooks:**
- Start mid-action (not intro)
- Text on screen immediately
- Movement in first frame
- Face close to camera
- Unexpected visual

### Step 4: Posting Strategy

**Optimal schedule:**

| Metric | Minimum | Ideal |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Posts/day** | 1 | 3-5 |
| **Posts/week** | 7 | 21+ |
| **Consistency** | Daily | Never miss a day |

**Best times to post:**
- Morning: 7-9 AM (catches morning scroll)
- Lunch: 12-2 PM (work breaks)
- Evening: 7-10 PM (peak usage)
- Test and analyze YOUR audience

**Algorithm signals:**

| Signal | Weight | How to Optimize |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Watch time** | Very High | Strong hooks, fast pacing |
| **Completion rate** | Very High | Keep videos short initially |
| **Shares** | High | Make content share-worthy |
| **Comments** | High | Ask questions, be controversial |
| **Saves** | High | Provide actionable value |
| **Likes** | Medium | Less important than above |

### Step 5: Trends and Sounds

**Using trends effectively:**

1. Check "Discover" page daily
2. Browse For You Page for 10 min
3. Identify trending sounds early
4. Adapt trend to your niche
5. Post within 24-48 hours of trend start

**Sound strategy:**

| Type | Usage | When |
|------|-------|------|
| **Trending sounds** | Ride algorithm boost | Early in trend lifecycle |
| **Original audio** | Build recognizability | Educational content |
| **Voiceover** | Explain complex topics | Tutorials, storytimes |
| **No sound** | Caption-based content | Informational posts |

### Step 6: Convert to Business Results

**TikTok funnel:**

```
Views → Profile visits → Link clicks → Leads/Sales
        ↓
     Followers → Repeat exposure → Trust → Conversion
```

**Conversion tactics:**
- Link in bio (optimize landing page for mobile)
- Pinned video with offer
- Comment replies with CTA
- Live streams with product demos
- TikTok Shop (if applicable)

**Lead capture:**
- Free resource (checklist, template)
- Email signup for exclusive content
- Discord/community invite
- Newsletter subscription
