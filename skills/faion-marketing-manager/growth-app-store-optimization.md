## Problem

Your app is live but invisible. The app stores are crowded with millions of apps. Without optimization, users can't find you. Paid ads are expensive, and organic discovery is free but requires strategy.

ASO is SEO for app stores. It's about being found for the right keywords and converting those impressions into downloads.

---

## Framework

ASO has two phases:

```
VISIBILITY  -> Get found in search results
CONVERSION  -> Get downloaded once found
```

### Step 1: Understand App Store Ranking Factors

**Apple App Store:**

| Factor | Weight | Controllable |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| App name | High | Yes |
| Subtitle | High | Yes |
| Keywords field | High | Yes |
| Downloads | Very High | Partially |
| Ratings/reviews | High | Partially |
| Retention/engagement | Medium | Partially |
| Update frequency | Low | Yes |

**Google Play:**

| Factor | Weight | Controllable |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Title | High | Yes |
| Short description | High | Yes |
| Full description | High | Yes |
| Downloads | Very High | Partially |
| Ratings/reviews | High | Partially |
| Engagement metrics | High | Partially |
| Backlinks | Low | Partially |

### Step 2: Keyword Research

**Find keywords:**

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| Competitor analysis | What do top apps rank for? |
| Autocomplete | Type in store, see suggestions |
| Related searches | What users also search |
| Review mining | What words do users use? |
| Tools | Sensor Tower, AppTweak, data.ai |

**Keyword evaluation:**

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Relevance | Does it describe your app? |
| Volume | Are people searching for it? |
| Difficulty | Can you rank for it? |
| Intent | Will searchers want your app? |

**Keyword spreadsheet:**
```
| Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Relevance | Priority |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|----------|
| [word]  | High   | Medium     | 10/10     | 1        |
| [word]  | Medium | Low        | 8/10      | 2        |
```

### Step 3: Optimize Metadata

**App Name (30 chars on iOS, 50 on Play):**
```
[Brand] - [Primary Keyword]

Examples:
- Spotify - Music and Podcasts
- Headspace - Sleep & Meditation
- Notion - Notes & Docs
```

**Subtitle/Short Description (30-80 chars):**
```
[Key benefit or secondary keywords]

Examples:
- "Track habits, build routines"
- "AI writing assistant for teams"
```

**iOS Keywords Field (100 chars):**
- No spaces, comma-separated
- No duplicates of name/subtitle
- Include misspellings, synonyms
- Singular only (Apple pluralizes)

**Google Play Description (4000 chars):**
- Keywords in first 1-2 sentences
- Bullet points for features
- Natural keyword density
- Repeat key terms 3-5 times

### Step 4: Visual Optimization

**App Icon:**

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Simple | One focal element |
| Recognizable | Unique, memorable |
| No text | Unreadable at small size |
| Consistent | Match brand colors |
| Test | A/B test variations |

**Screenshots:**

| Best Practice | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| First 2 most important | Many don't scroll |
| Show features in action | Not empty states |
| Text overlay | Explain what they see |
| Emotional outcome | Not just features |
| Consistent style | Professional feel |

**Screenshot formula:**
```
[Headline: Benefit/outcome]
[App screen showing feature]
```

**Video preview:**
- 15-30 seconds
- First 3 seconds = hook
- Show real app usage
- No talking, just demo
- End with CTA

### Step 5: Ratings and Reviews

**Get more reviews:**

| Tactic | When |
|--------|------|
| In-app prompt | After positive action |
| Delay timing | After 3+ sessions |
| Smart targeting | Active users only |
| Follow-up | After good support interaction |

**Handle negative reviews:**
- Respond within 24 hours
- Acknowledge the issue
- Offer solution or contact
- Ask them to update if fixed

**Review response template:**
```

[How we'll fix or have fixed]

We'd appreciate if you could update your review if we've resolved this.

```

### Step 6: Localization

1. English (US, UK)
2. Spanish (LATAM + Spain)
3. Portuguese (Brazil)
4. German (DACH)
5. French
6. Japanese
7. Korean

**What to localize:**
