# Topical Authority

## Problem

Keyword density doesn't correlate with rankings anymore.

## Solution: Build Topical Authority

```

   - Pillar page (comprehensive overview)
   - Supporting articles (subtopics)
   - Internal linking structure

2. **Content Depth**
   - Answer all related questions
   - Cover edge cases
   - Update regularly

3. **External Signals**
   - Quality backlinks
   - Brand mentions
   - Social signals
   - Expert citations

**Example Cluster:**
```
Pillar: "Complete Guide to RAG"
+-- What is RAG?
+-- RAG vs Fine-tuning
+-- RAG Architecture Patterns
+-- RAG Evaluation Methods
+-- RAG Tools Comparison
