# Zero-Click Search Adaptation

## Problem

Nearly 60% of all Google searches end without clicks. AI Overviews show 83% zero-click rate. Publishers report traffic losses up to 40%.

## Solution: Shift from Traffic to Visibility

**Current State (2026):**
- 58.5% US searches = zero-click
- 59.7% EU searches = zero-click

**CTR Impact:**
- Organic CTR: 1.76% -> 0.61% with AI Overviews (-61%)
