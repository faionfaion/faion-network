# SEO & AI Search Best Practices 2026

## M-MKT-073: Search Everywhere Optimization

### Problem

Traditional SEO only targets Google. Users now search on ChatGPT, Perplexity, TikTok, YouTube. The reliance on traditional search engines is expected to drop by 25% by 2026. Semrush predicts LLM traffic will overtake traditional Google search by end of 2027.

### Solution: Multi-Platform Visibility

**Search Landscape 2026:**

| Platform | Market Share | Optimization | Key Focus |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Google | 90% | Traditional SEO | AI Overviews (30% of searches) |
| ChatGPT/Perplexity | 400M+ weekly users | GEO | Entity relationships |
| YouTube | #2 search engine | Video SEO | Shorts + long-form |
| TikTok | Gen Z primary | Short-form video | TikTok Search |
| Amazon | Product search | A9 algorithm | Voice commerce ($80B by 2026) |

**GEO (Generative Engine Optimization):**
```
Traditional SEO: Rank in search results (positions 1-10)
GEO: Get cited in AI-generated answers (be THE source)
```

**Core GEO Principles:**
- Focus on being the source AI engines cite, reference, or recommend
- Topic targeting over keyword targeting (broader subjects vs specific phrases)
- Brand visibility and mentions over rankings
- Structured, succinct content for easy extraction
- Entity relationships and semantic clarity

**GEO Best Practices:**
1. Become authoritative source (citations, backlinks, earned media)
2. Provide clear, structured information
3. Use schema markup for machine readability
4. Create comprehensive, well-researched content
5. Update content frequently (within 30 days = 3.2x more citations)
6. Build consensus across owned and earned media
7. Focus on original insights, frameworks, comparisons

**GEO Tools:**
- Semrush AI Visibility Toolkit (launched 2025)
- Similarweb Gen AI Intelligence
- Otterly.AI, Profound for tracking

**GEO Metrics:**
- AI Visibility Score: frequency of brand appearance in AI responses
- Source Citations: times AI models reference/link to content
- AI Share of Voice: % of relevant AI answers mentioning brand
- Time-to-Citation: days from publishing to first AI citation

**AEO (Answer Engine Optimization):**

AEO is the process of making content easy for AI-powered systems to find, understand, and cite.

**Why AEO Matters:**
- 80% of consumers rely on zero-click results
- Gartner: 25% of organic search traffic shifts to AI chatbots by 2026
- Voice commerce reaching $80B by 2026

**AEO Best Practices:**
- Target featured snippets and AI Overviews
- Use question-answer format (match "People Also Ask" queries)
- Provide direct, concise answers immediately after headings
- Implement FAQ, HowTo, and Speakable schema
- Short paragraphs (2-4 lines), bullet points, tables
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Platform-specific optimization:
  - Google: SEO readiness + helpful content
  - Perplexity: clarity, recency, citations
  - ChatGPT: behavior varies, focus on authority

**AEO Metrics:**
- Citation rate: share of answers linking to your domain
- Sentiment: tone in AI responses
- Entity correctness: accurate brand/product representation
- Share of citations by content type
