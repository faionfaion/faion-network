# AI Content Strategy

## Problem

AI-generated content is everywhere. How to stand out when AI can generate content at scale?

## Solution: AI + Human Collaboration

**The Evolution:**
- 2024: AI content generation adoption
- 2025: No-code AI agents adoption
- 2026: Agentic workflows integration (n8n, GPT AgentKit, Google Opal)

**The New Content Stack:**
```
AI Research -> AI Draft -> Human Expert Edit -> Human QA -> Publish
      |
Agentic Workflows: Entire support teams using AI agents
```

**What AI Does Well:**
- Keyword research and topic brainstorming
- Outline generation and first drafts
- SEO optimization and metadata
- Content repurposing across formats
- Personalization at scale (anticipate individual preferences)

**What Humans Must Do:**
- Strategy and positioning
- Expert insights and first-hand experience
- Brand voice enforcement
- Fact verification and quality control
- Original insights AI hasn't seen before

**Google E-E-A-T Emphasis:**
To counter AI content flooding, Google emphasizes Experience:
- Share content based on first-hand experiences
- Demonstrate real expertise, not just aggregated info
- Show credentials and build personal authority

**Content Differentiation:**
| Generic AI Content | Differentiated Content |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Summary of top 10 results | Original research/data |
| Generic advice | Specific case studies |
| Surface-level | Expert depth |
| No opinion | Strong POV with reasoning |
| No examples | Real examples with outcomes |
| Can tell what product is | Can tell how it feels to use it |

**Best Practices:**
- Don't just "prompt and publish"
- Add proprietary data and insights
- Include expert quotes and interviews
- Share real experiences and failures
- Take positions on controversial topics
- Be specific about target audience and message
- Keep human oversight in the process
- Set clear boundaries for AI use

**AI Content Tools:**
- Content creation: ChatGPT, Jasper, Copy.ai (drafts, repurposing, brainstorming)
- SEO optimization: Surfer, MarketMuse, Clearscope (structure, coverage)
- Multi-channel: Blaze.ai (creation + distribution)
- Ad copy: Persado, Phrasee (data-driven testing)

**Industry Stats:**
- 77% marketing departments adopt AI (highest rate)
- 51% sales teams adopt AI
- Over half of gen AI enterprise budgets go to sales/marketing
