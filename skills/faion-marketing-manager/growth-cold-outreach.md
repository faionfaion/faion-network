## Problem

You need customers but have no audience. Inbound takes months to build. Cold outreach can get you customers this week, but most cold emails are terrible. They sound desperate, offer nothing of value, and go straight to spam.

Done right, cold outreach is a superpower. It scales faster than content and costs less than ads. But you must be relevant, valuable, and human.

---

## Framework

Effective cold outreach follows this structure:

```
TARGET    -> Identify right prospects
RESEARCH  -> Find personalization angles
WRITE     -> Craft compelling messages
SEND      -> Use proper infrastructure
FOLLOW UP -> 80% of replies come from follow-ups
```

### Step 1: Build Your Target List

**Ideal prospect criteria:**

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Pain | Do they have the problem I solve? |
| Budget | Can they afford my solution? |
| Authority | Can they make buying decisions? |
| Timing | Is now a good time for them? |
| Reach | Can I find their contact info? |

**Finding prospects:**

| Source | Best For | Tools |
|--------|----------|-------|
| LinkedIn Sales Nav | B2B, specific roles | Sales Navigator |
| Industry lists | Curated niches | Clutch, G2 |
| Job boards | Companies hiring X | Indeed, LinkedIn |
| Trigger events | Recent news, funding | Crunchbase, news |
| Competitors | Competitive displacement | BuiltWith, reviews |

**List size:** Start with 100-200 highly targeted prospects.

### Step 2: Research Each Prospect

**Personalization levels:**

| Level | Time | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Batch** | 30 sec | Company name, industry |
| **Light** | 2 min | Recent post, company news |
| **Deep** | 10 min | Specific pain point from research |

**Research sources:**
- LinkedIn profile and posts
- Company blog and news
- Twitter/X activity
- Podcast appearances
- Job postings (reveal pain points)

**Capture relevant details:**
```
Company: [Name]
Person: [Name, Title]
Pain signal: [What indicates they need help]
Personalization hook: [Recent post, news, connection]
```

### Step 3: Write Your Cold Email

**Anatomy of a great cold email:**

| Element | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Subject line | Get opened | 4-6 words |
| Opening | Personalization + relevance | 1-2 sentences |
| Value prop | Why should they care | 2-3 sentences |
| CTA | What to do next | 1 sentence |

**Subject line formulas:**
```
[Question about pain point]
- "Quick question about [topic]"
- "[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out"
- "Idea for [company]"
- "[Their recent achievement]"
```

**Opening formulas:**
```
Observation-based:
"Saw your post about [topic] - really resonated with [point]."

Trigger-based:
"Congrats on the Series A! With 20 new hires coming, [challenge] becomes..."

Mutual connection:
"[Name] mentioned you're working on [initiative]."
```

**Body structure:**
```
[Personalized opening - shows you did research]

[Connect to pain point they likely have]

[How you solve it - be specific, short]

[Social proof if relevant - one line max]

[CTA - easy, low commitment]
```

### Step 4: Send Infrastructure

**Deliverability essentials:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Domain | Separate domain for cold email |
| Warmup | 2-4 weeks before sending at scale |
| SPF/DKIM/DMARC | Properly configured |
| Volume | <50/day per inbox (start lower) |
| Unsubscribe | One-click unsubscribe link |

**Tools by stage:**
- Finding emails: Hunter, Apollo, Clearbit
- Verification: NeverBounce, ZeroBounce
- Sending: Instantly, Smartlead, Apollo
- Warmup: Instantly, Warmbox

### Step 5: Follow-Up Sequence

**The follow-up cadence:**

| Day | Email | Content |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 0 | Initial | Full pitch |
| 3 | Follow-up 1 | Bump, add value |
| 7 | Follow-up 2 | Different angle |
| 14 | Follow-up 3 | Case study |
| 21 | Break-up | Last attempt |

**Follow-up templates:**

```
Follow-up 1 (Day 3):
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Just wanted to bump this up. Did you get a chance to see my note?

[Original email below]
```

```
Follow-up 2 (Day 7):
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

```

timing is better.
