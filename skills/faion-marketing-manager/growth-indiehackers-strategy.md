## Problem

You're building a product but feeling isolated. You need feedback, accountability, and an audience of potential customers. IndieHackers is full of your target market, but most makers post once and get ignored.

IndieHackers is a community, not a billboard. The makers who succeed are the ones who give before they take.

---

## Framework

IndieHackers success follows the give-first approach:

```
JOIN       -> Create profile, explore community
GIVE       -> Help others for 2-4 weeks before promoting
BUILD      -> Share journey transparently (wins and losses)
GROW       -> Convert community relationships to customers
```

### Step 1: Set Up Your Profile

**Profile elements:**

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| Photo | Real photo (builds trust) |
| Bio | What you're building + your background |
| Product | Link to your product page |
| Milestones | Add revenue milestones (optional) |
| Social | Link Twitter/X for cross-following |

**Product page:**
- Clear description of what you build
- Revenue (even if $0 - transparency wins)
- Stack and tools used
- Your story

### Step 2: Contribute First

**Before promoting, spend 2-4 weeks:**

| Activity | How Often | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Answer questions | Daily | Build reputation |
| Share helpful resources | 2x/week | Provide value |
| Comment on others' posts | Daily | Build relationships |
| Upvote good content | Daily | Support community |

**Types of helpful content:**
- Answer "how do I..." questions
- Share relevant experiences
- Recommend tools (not your own)
- Provide honest feedback on ideas
- Connect people who should meet

### Step 3: Build in Public

**What to share:**

| Type | Frequency | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Revenue updates | Monthly | "Month 3: $500 MRR" |
| Wins | As they happen | "Got my first customer!" |
| Losses | As they happen | "Failed experiment..." |
| Learnings | Weekly | "What I learned about..." |
| Behind-the-scenes | Weekly | Screenshots, processes |

**Monthly update template:**
```markdown
## [Month] Update: [Product Name]

**Revenue:** $X MRR (+/-Y% from last month)
**Users:** X active

**What worked:**
- [Win 1]
- [Win 2]

**What didn't work:**
- [Loss 1]
- [Loss 2]

**Key learnings:**
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]

**Next month's focus:**
- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]

Questions for the community:
- [Question 1]?
```

### Step 4: Ask for Feedback

**Effective feedback posts:**

| Element | Good | Bad |
|---------|------|-----|
| Specificity | "How can I improve my pricing page?" | "Feedback please" |
| Context | Share what you've tried | Ask without background |
| Engagement | Reply to every comment | Post and disappear |
| Format | Screenshots, specific questions | Wall of text |

**Feedback request template:**
```markdown
## [Specific question about specific thing]

**Context:**
I'm building [product] for [audience].
Currently at [stage/revenue].

**The problem:**
[What I'm struggling with]

**What I've tried:**
- [Attempt 1]
- [Attempt 2]

**Specific questions:**
1. [Question 1]?
2. [Question 2]?

```

### Step 5: Leverage Milestones

**Shareable milestones:**
- First sale
- $100 MRR
- $1,000 MRR
- $10,000 MRR
- First 100 users
- Profitable month
- Quitting day job

**Milestone post formula:**
```markdown
## I just hit [Milestone]! Here's what I learned

**The journey:**
- Started: [date]
- How long: [X months]
- What I built: [brief description]

**What worked:**
1. [Strategy 1] - [why it worked]
2. [Strategy 2] - [why it worked]
3. [Strategy 3] - [why it worked]

**What I'd do differently:**
- [Mistake 1]
- [Mistake 2]

**Ask me anything!**
```
