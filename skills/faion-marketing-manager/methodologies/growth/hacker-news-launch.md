## Problem

Hacker News can send massive traffic to your product, but it's notoriously hard to crack. Most posts die with zero upvotes. The community is skeptical of marketing, harsh on mediocrity, and rewards substance over hype.

Understanding HN culture is essential. What works on Product Hunt fails spectacularly here. Get it right, and you can reach millions of developers and tech leaders.

---

## Framework

HN success requires understanding the platform's unique culture:

```
UNDERSTAND  -> HN values substance, authenticity, technical depth
PARTICIPATE -> Build reputation before posting
POST        -> Choose right format and timing
ENGAGE      -> Respond thoughtfully to all feedback
```

### Step 1: Understand HN Culture

**What HN values:**
- Technical depth and innovation
- Open source and transparency
- Honesty about limitations
- Intellectual curiosity
- Anti-marketing stance

**What HN dislikes:**
- Marketing speak and buzzwords
- Clickbait titles
- Hype without substance
- Aggressive self-promotion
- Defensive responses to criticism

**HN audience:**
- Developers and engineers
- Startup founders (technical)
- Tech executives
- Investors (YC affiliated)
- Students and researchers

### Step 2: Build Reputation First

**Before launching, participate:**

| Activity | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Comment thoughtfully | Build karma, become known |
| Share interesting links (not your own) | Establish taste |
| Answer technical questions | Show expertise |
| Time: 2-4 weeks minimum | Build history |

**Karma guidelines:**
- Having history helps posts gain traction
- New accounts with only self-promotion get flagged
- Quality of comments matters more than quantity

### Step 3: Choose Your Format

**Post types that work:**

| Type | Format | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Show HN** | Show HN: [Product] - [Description] | Launching products |
| **Launch HN** | Launch HN: [Company] | YC companies (with YC flair) |
| **Blog Post** | [Interesting technical title] | Deep technical content |
| **Open Source** | Show HN: [Repo] - [Description] | OSS projects |

**Title formula for Show HN:**
```
Show HN: [What it does] - [How it's different/interesting]

Good:
- "Show HN: A terminal-based Git client written in Rust"
- "Show HN: We built a search engine for research papers"
- "Show HN: Open source alternative to [commercial tool]"

Bad:
- "Show HN: The best way to manage your tasks" (marketing)
- "Show HN: Check out our startup!" (vague)
- "Show HN: Revolutionary AI-powered..." (hyperbolic)
```

### Step 4: Optimize Your Post

**Landing page requirements for HN:**
- Fast loading (no heavy animations)
- Clear explanation of what it does
- Demo or screenshots immediately visible
- Technical details available
- Pricing transparent (or "free")
- No aggressive pop-ups

**First comment (for Show HN):**
- Technical backstory
- What problem you're solving
- Why you built it this way
- What you want feedback on
- Honest about limitations

### Step 5: Timing

**Best times to post:**
- 8-10 AM ET (US morning)
- Weekdays (Tue-Thu best)
- Avoid: Weekends, holidays, major tech news days

**Why timing matters:**
- Initial velocity determines visibility
- You need upvotes in first 1-2 hours
- Posts on front page get exponential traffic

### Step 6: Engage Authentically

**Response guidelines:**

| Feedback Type | How to Respond |
|---------------|----------------|
| Technical critique | Thank them, explain your reasoning |
| Bug reports | Acknowledge, fix quickly, update |
| Feature requests | Note interest, share roadmap |
| Harsh criticism | Stay calm, find the valid point |
| Trolls | Ignore or brief factual response |

**Never:**
- Get defensive
- Attack critics
- Make excuses
- Ignore legitimate issues
- Ask for upvotes

Structure:
1. The problem we faced
2. Approaches we considered
3. What we built and why
4. Technical deep-dive
5. Results and learnings
6. What's next

Include:
