## Problem

You need to generate leads and demonstrate expertise, but written content isn't enough. Prospects want to see you in action before committing. Webinars combine education and demonstration, but most are boring PowerPoint presentations that drive no action.

A great webinar builds trust, showcases expertise, and converts attendees to customers in real-time.

---

## Framework

Successful webinars follow a systematic approach:

```
PLAN      -> Topic, format, promotion strategy
PROMOTE   -> Drive registrations
DELIVER   -> Engaging, valuable presentation
CONVERT   -> Follow-up for action
REPURPOSE -> Extract more value from content
```

### Step 1: Choose Your Webinar Type

**Webinar formats:**

| Type | Best For | Conversion Style |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **Educational** | Lead generation | Soft CTA, nurture |
| **Demo** | Product showcase | Direct CTA |
| **Q&A/AMA** | Community building | Relationship building |
| **Panel/Interview** | Authority building | Content value |
| **Workshop** | Deep engagement | Premium offer |
| **Launch event** | Product launches | Urgency-based |

**Topic selection criteria:**
- Solves a pressing problem for target audience
- You have unique expertise to share
- Natural connection to your product
- Specific enough to be actionable
- Broad enough to attract audience

### Step 2: Plan Your Webinar

**Key decisions:**

| Element | Consideration |
|---------|---------------|
| **Duration** | 45-60 min (30 content, 15-30 Q&A) |
| **Platform** | Zoom, Demio, Livestorm |
| **Timing** | Tue-Thu, 11am or 2pm (audience timezone) |
| **Co-host** | Solo or with guest/partner? |
| **Frequency** | Monthly is sustainable |

**Content structure:**
```
0:00 - 5:00   Welcome, housekeeping, intro
5:00 - 10:00  Hook: Problem statement
10:00 - 35:00 Main content (3-5 key points)
35:00 - 40:00 Your solution (soft pitch)
40:00 - 55:00 Q&A
55:00 - 60:00 Recap, CTA, close
```

### Step 3: Promote Registrations

**Promotion timeline:**

| Timing | Action |
|--------|--------|
| 3 weeks before | Announce, start promotion |
| 2 weeks before | Guest post, podcast pitch |
| 1 week before | Email sequence starts |
| Day before | Reminder email |
| Day of | Final reminder (1 hour before) |
| After | Replay promotion |

**Promotion channels:**

| Channel | Tactic |
|---------|--------|
| Email list | 3-email sequence |
| Social media | Multiple posts with countdown |
| Website | Banner, popup |
| Partners | Cross-promotion |

**Registration page elements:**
- Clear value proposition
- Date/time with timezone converter

**Presentation tips:**
- Energy higher than normal (camera dampens)

```

**Post-webinar sequence:**
