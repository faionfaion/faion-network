## Problem

LinkedIn has 900M+ professionals, including your B2B customers. But most people use it wrong. They post corporate-speak, share company announcements nobody cares about, and get zero engagement.

The platform rewards personal stories, authentic takes, and value-add content. The organic reach is still incredible compared to other platforms.

---

## Framework

LinkedIn success follows a simple formula:

```
OPTIMIZE  -> Profile that converts
CREATE    -> Content that resonates
ENGAGE    -> Build real connections
CONVERT   -> Turn attention to business
```

### Step 1: Optimize Your Profile

**Profile as landing page:**

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| **Headline** | Not just title - value proposition |
| **Photo** | Professional, friendly, recent |
| **Banner** | Reinforce your message |
| **About** | Story + offer + CTA |
| **Featured** | Best content, lead magnets |
| **Experience** | Results-focused, not duties |

**Headline formula:**
```
[What you do] | [For whom] | [Proof or differentiator]

Examples:
- Helping SaaS founders hit $1M ARR | 3x exits | DM me "growth"
- Building AI tools for marketers | CEO @ProductName | ex-Google
- Writing about product strategy | 50K newsletter | Author of [Book]
```

**About section structure:**
```
[Hook - relatable pain point or achievement]

[Your story in 3-4 sentences]

[What you offer/do now]

[Proof points]

[Clear CTA]

[Contact info]
```

### Step 2: Content Strategy

**Content that performs:**

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Personal stories** | Vulnerability + lesson | "I got fired and it was the best thing" |
| **Contrarian takes** | Challenge common beliefs | "Unpopular opinion: X is wrong" |
| **How-to posts** | Actionable value | "5 steps to do X" |
| **Lessons learned** | Experience-based | "After 10 years in X, here's what I know" |
| **Carousels** | Visual guides | "The complete guide to X [swipe]" |

**Post structure:**
```
Hook (line 1)
[Attention-grabbing first line - this shows in feed]

Gap
[Skip a line for readability]

Story/Context
[2-3 short paragraphs]

Value/Lesson
[The insight or actionable takeaway]

CTA
[Question or simple call to action]
```

### Step 3: Posting Schedule

**Optimal rhythm:**

| Content Type | Frequency |
|--------------|-----------|
| Text posts | 3-5/week |
| Carousels | 1-2/week |
| Videos | 1/week (optional) |
| Comments | Daily (20+) |
| Connection requests | 5-10/day |

**Best posting times:**
- Tuesday-Thursday: Highest engagement
- 7-8 AM, 12 PM, 5-6 PM (audience timezone)
- Avoid weekends for B2B content

### Step 4: Engagement Strategy

**Comment strategy:**
1. Follow key people in your niche
2. Comment early on their posts
3. Add value (not just "Great post!")
4. Ask thoughtful questions

**Comment formula:**
```
[Specific reaction to their point]
[Your experience or addition]
[Question or insight]

Example:
"This resonates. I tried X approach last year and found Y worked better for our audience. Have you tested that variation?"
```

**Connection strategy:**
- Personalize connection requests
- Connect with engaged commenters
- Follow up with value, not a pitch

### Step 5: Convert to Business

**Lead generation:**

| Tactic | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Lead magnets** | Link to free resource in featured |
| **DM sequences** | Welcome new followers with value |
| **Newsletter** | CTA at end of posts |
| **Content mentions** | Natural product references |
| **Creator mode** | Enable for newsletter link |

**DM welcome template:**
```
Hey [Name], thanks for connecting!

I noticed you're [something specific from their profile].

I share [content type] about [topic] here - hope you find it useful.

If you ever want to chat about [topic], always happy to connect.

[Name]
```
