## Problem

Press coverage can put your startup in front of millions, but most founders never get it. They send generic press releases into the void, pitch the wrong journalists, and give up after being ignored.

Media coverage is earned. Journalists need stories that serve their readers. Your job is to make their job easier by providing a newsworthy angle and everything they need to write about you.

---

## Framework

Getting press coverage follows a relationship-driven approach:

```
IDENTIFY  -> Find relevant journalists
RESEARCH  -> Understand what they cover
ANGLE     -> Create newsworthy story
PITCH     -> Make it easy for them
LEVERAGE  -> Maximize coverage impact
```

### Step 1: Identify Target Media

**Tiered approach:**

| Tier | Examples | When to Target |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Tier 1** | TechCrunch, Wired, NYT | Major news, big funding |
| **Tier 2** | Industry publications | Product launches, features |
| **Tier 3** | Niche blogs, newsletters | Any relevant news |
| **Local** | Local newspapers, radio | Community angle |

**Start with Tier 3.** Build coverage history before approaching Tier 1.

**Find relevant journalists:**

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| Twitter/X search | "[Publication] + [beat]" |
| Publication search | Browse relevant sections |
| Similar coverage | Who wrote about competitors? |
| HARO/Qwoted | Respond to journalist queries |
| Muckrack/Cision | Media databases |

### Step 2: Research Each Journalist

**Before pitching, know:**

| Element | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Beat | What topics they cover |
| Recent articles | Current interests |
| Writing style | How they tell stories |
| Social media | Personality, preferences |
| Pitch preferences | Email, DM, specific format |

**Build journalist profiles:**
```
Name: [Full name]
Publication: [Name]
Beat: [Topics they cover]
Contact: [Email, Twitter]
Recent articles: [3-5 relevant pieces]
Angle that might work: [Your idea]
```

### Step 3: Create Your Story Angle

**Newsworthy angles:**

| Angle | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **First** | First product to do X |
| **Trend** | Riding a larger trend |
| **Data** | Original research/survey |
| **Founder story** | Unique personal journey |
| **Funding** | Investment announcement |
| **Milestone** | Significant user/revenue milestone |
| **Launch** | Major product/feature launch |
| **Contrarian** | Challenging industry norm |

**Story formula:**
```
[Who] + [Did what] + [So what (impact)] + [Why now]

Example:
"Bootstrapped founder reaches $1M ARR by doing opposite of VC advice,
proving small can win against well-funded competitors in the age of AI."
```

### Step 4: Craft Your Pitch

**Pitch structure:**

| Element | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Subject line | Get opened | <8 words |
| Hook | Why this matters | 1-2 sentences |
| Story | The news | 2-3 sentences |
| Why them | Personal relevance | 1 sentence |
| Assets | Make it easy | List of available items |
| CTA | Clear next step | 1 sentence |

**Pitch template:**
```
Subject: [Specific, newsy subject]

[The news in 2-3 sentences - who, what, why it matters]

[Why this fits their beat/interests]

```

### Step 5: Provide a Press Kit

**Press kit includes:**

| Asset | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Founder bio | 50-word and 200-word versions |
| Company boilerplate | 100-word company description |
| High-res logos | PNG and SVG formats |
| Product screenshots | Professional quality |
| Founder photos | Headshot, candid, action |
| Key stats | User numbers, revenue, growth |
| Quotes | Pre-approved quotable statements |
| Fact sheet | Key facts in bullet points |

**Host at:** yourdomain.com/press

### Step 6: Follow Up & Leverage

**Follow-up:**
- Wait 3-5 days before first follow-up
- Maximum 2 follow-ups total
- Accept "no" gracefully

**When you get coverage:**
- Share on social media and tag journalist
- Add to "As Seen In" section on website
- Email your list about the coverage
- Thank the journalist publicly
- Maintain the relationship
