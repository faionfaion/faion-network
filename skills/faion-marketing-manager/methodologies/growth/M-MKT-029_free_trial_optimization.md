## Problem

You're getting trial signups but few convert to paid. People sign up with good intentions but never experience the value. Without intervention, most trials end in silence - no conversion, no feedback.

Free trial optimization is about guiding users to their "aha moment" as fast as possible. The faster they get value, the more likely they convert.

---

## Framework

Trial optimization follows the value-first approach:

```
ONBOARD   -> Fastest path to first value
ENGAGE    -> Keep them active during trial
CONVERT   -> Clear path from trial to paid
RESCUE    -> Win back inactive trials
```

### Step 1: Define Your Activation Metric

**The aha moment:**
- Slack: Sent 2,000 messages as a team
- Dropbox: Saved 1 file to a folder
- Twitter: Followed 30 users
- Facebook: Made 7 friends in 10 days

**Find your aha moment:**
1. Identify your happiest paying customers
2. What did they all do during trial?
3. Validate: do people who do X convert more?

**Activation formula:**
```
[Action] + [Quantity] + [Timeframe] = Activated

Examples:
- Created 1 project in first session
- Invited 1 team member in first 3 days
- Completed 1 full workflow in first week
```

### Step 2: Design Onboarding Flow

**First-time user experience:**

| Step | Goal | Implementation |
|------|------|----------------|
| 1. Welcome | Set expectations | Welcome screen + key value |
| 2. Quick setup | Basic configuration | Minimal required info |
| 3. First action | Get to value | Guided first task |
| 4. Confirmation | Reinforce success | Celebration moment |
| 5. Next steps | Continue journey | Clear what's next |

**Reduce time to value:**
- Pre-fill sample data (don't start empty)
- Skip optional steps
- Defer advanced features
- Progressive disclosure

**Onboarding checklist pattern:**
```
Welcome to [Product]!

Complete your setup:
[x] Create your account
[x] Connect your data source
[ ] Set up your first report
[ ] Invite a team member

2 of 4 complete
```

### Step 3: Trial Communication Sequence

**Email touchpoints:**

| Day | Email | Purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 0 | Welcome | Immediate value, one action |
| 1 | Quick start | Remove blockers, show help |
| 3 | Feature highlight | Showcase key feature |
| 5 | Case study | Social proof, inspiration |
| 7 | Mid-trial check-in | Offer help, gather feedback |
| 10 | Countdown begins | Create awareness of end |
| 13 | 1 day left | Urgency, clear CTA |
| 14 | Trial ended | Invite to subscribe, offer help |
| 17 | Win-back | Special offer if not converted |

**Email best practices:**
- Single focus per email
- Short (under 150 words)
- Clear CTA
- From a person, not company
- Trigger-based when possible

### Step 4: In-App Engagement

**Keep users active:**

| Tactic | When |
|--------|------|
| Progress indicators | Throughout trial |
| Feature discovery | After completing basics |
| Usage tips | Contextual, triggered |
| Empty states | Guide action, not just message |
| Achievement celebrations | After milestones |

**Trial countdown:**
```
Trial: 5 days remaining
[Upgrade to Pro]

What you'll lose:
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]
```

### Step 5: Conversion Mechanics

**Pricing presentation:**
- Show during trial (not hidden)
- Compare trial vs paid features
- Highlight what they're already using
- Provide social proof at decision point

**Reduce conversion friction:**
- Remember payment info from checkout
- Offer monthly start (even if annual preferred)
- Risk reversal (guarantee, easy cancel)
- Answer objections proactively

**Trial-to-paid transition:**
```
Good:
- Seamless upgrade, keep all data
- Pro-rated if upgrading early
- Clear confirmation of what changes

Bad:
- Data loss or export required
- Complex pricing calculation
- Unclear next steps
```

### Step 6: Rescue Inactive Trials

**Identify at-risk signals:**
- No login in 3+ days
- Didn't complete onboarding
- Only used 1 feature
- No team invites

**Re-engagement tactics:**

| Signal | Response |
|--------|----------|
| No login | "Did you get stuck?" email |
| Stuck in onboarding | Offer 1:1 help |
| Low usage | Feature education |
| Churned without feedback | Exit survey |

**Trial extension offer:**
```
