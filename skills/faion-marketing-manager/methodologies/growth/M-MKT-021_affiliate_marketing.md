## Problem

You want to scale customer acquisition without spending on ads or building everything yourself. Affiliate marketing lets others sell for you, but most programs fail. They attract low-quality partners, create brand confusion, or cost more than they return.

A great affiliate program aligns incentives and empowers partners to succeed. It becomes a true growth channel, not a distraction.

## Framework

Building an effective affiliate program:

```
STRUCTURE -> Design commission and terms
RECRUIT   -> Find quality affiliates
ENABLE    -> Give them tools to succeed
MANAGE    -> Track, pay, optimize
SCALE     -> Expand what works
```

### Step 1: Design Your Program

**Commission structures:**

| Model | How It Works | Best For |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **% of sale** | 20-40% of first payment | Subscriptions, digital |
| **Recurring** | % of all payments (lifetime) | SaaS, memberships |
| **Flat fee** | $50-200 per sale | High-ticket, services |
| **Tiered** | Higher % at higher volumes | Motivating top performers |
| **Two-tier** | % for affiliate's referrals | MLM-style (careful) |

**Decide key terms:**

| Term | Consideration |
|------|---------------|
| **Commission rate** | Competitive but sustainable (aim for <30% of LTV) |
| **Cookie duration** | 30-90 days typical |
| **Payment threshold** | $50-100 minimum payout |
| **Payment schedule** | Monthly, after refund window |
| **Attribution** | First-touch, last-touch, or multi-touch |

### Step 2: Create Affiliate Assets

**What affiliates need:**

|-------|---------|

| **Course creators** | Recommend as part of curriculum | Low |
| **Agencies** | Recommend to clients | Medium |
| **Power users** | Existing customers | Low |
| **Comparison sites** | Review/comparison focus | Medium |

**Outreach template:**
