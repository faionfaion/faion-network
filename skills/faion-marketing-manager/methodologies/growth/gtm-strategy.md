## Problem

You have a great product but no clear plan to bring it to market. Without a GTM strategy, you waste money on random tactics, miss your target audience, and lose to competitors who launch faster and smarter.

Most founders skip GTM planning. They build first, figure out sales later. This leads to building features nobody wants and marketing to people who will never buy.

---

## Framework

A Go-to-Market strategy answers 5 questions:

```
WHO        → Target customer (specific, not "everyone")
WHAT       → Value proposition (why they should care)
WHERE      → Channels (where they hang out)
HOW        → Sales motion (self-serve, sales-led, hybrid)
WHEN       → Launch timeline (phased rollout)
```

### Step 1: Define Your Target Customer

**Create an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):**

```markdown
## ICP Template

**Company (B2B):**
- Industry: [e.g., SaaS, E-commerce]
- Size: [e.g., 10-50 employees]
- Revenue: [e.g., $1M-$10M ARR]
- Tech stack: [e.g., Uses Slack, Notion]
- Pain point: [specific problem]

**Person (B2C or B2B buyer):**
- Role: [e.g., Marketing Manager]
- Goals: [what they want to achieve]
- Frustrations: [current pain points]
- Budget: [decision-making power]
- Where they learn: [blogs, podcasts, communities]
```

**Anti-ICP:** Also define who is NOT your customer:
- Too small (can not afford)
- Too large (needs enterprise features)
- Wrong industry
- Wrong stage

### Step 2: Craft Your Value Proposition

**Use this formula:**

```
For [TARGET CUSTOMER]
Who [HAS THIS PROBLEM]
Our [PRODUCT]
Is a [CATEGORY]
That [KEY BENEFIT]
Unlike [COMPETITORS]
We [UNIQUE DIFFERENTIATOR]
```

**Example:**
```
For solopreneurs building digital products
Who struggle with scattered tools and no methodology
Our Faion Network
Is an AI-powered development framework
That provides 282 proven methodologies and AI agents
Unlike generic courses or just tools
We combine education with working software
```

### Step 3: Select Your Channels

**Channel categories:**

| Type | Channels | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Organic** | SEO, Content, Social, Community | Long-term, low CAC |
| **Paid** | Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn | Fast scaling, testing |
| **Outbound** | Email, Cold calls, Events | High-value B2B |
| **Partnerships** | Affiliates, Integrations | Leverage existing audiences |
| **Product-led** | Freemium, Viral loops | Self-serve products |

**Choose 2-3 channels initially.** More dilutes focus.

### Step 4: Define Sales Motion

| Motion | Best For | Characteristics |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Self-serve** | Low price (<$50/mo), simple product | No sales team, product-led |
| **Sales-assisted** | Mid-market ($50-500/mo) | Inside sales, demos |
| **Enterprise** | High value ($10k+/year) | Field sales, long cycles |
| **Hybrid** | Multiple segments | Self-serve + sales escalation |

### Step 5: Plan Your Launch

**Phased approach:**

```
Phase 1: Private Beta (2-4 weeks)
- 50-100 hand-picked users
- High-touch feedback
- Fix critical bugs

Phase 2: Public Beta (2-4 weeks)
- Open waitlist
- Early access pricing
- Gather testimonials

Phase 3: General Availability
- Full launch
- PR push
- Paid acquisition starts
```
