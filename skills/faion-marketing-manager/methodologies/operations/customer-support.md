## Problem

Customers have questions, issues, and frustrations. Without good support, they churn, leave bad reviews, and tell others to avoid you. But as a solopreneur, you can't be available 24/7.

Customer support means helping customers succeed while keeping your workload manageable.

---

## Framework

Support scales through this hierarchy:

```
SELF-SERVE -> Documentation, FAQ, knowledge base
ASYNC      -> Email, chat (delayed response OK)
REAL-TIME  -> Live chat, calls (for urgent/high-value)
PROACTIVE  -> Anticipate and prevent issues
```

### Step 1: Build Self-Service First

**Self-service assets:**

| Asset | Purpose | Effort to Create |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| FAQ | Common questions | Low |
| Knowledge base | How-to guides | Medium |
| Video tutorials | Visual learners | Medium |
| Interactive guides | In-app help | High |
| Community forum | Peer support | Medium |

**FAQ structure:**

```markdown
## Getting Started
- How do I create an account?
- How do I set up [core feature]?

## Billing
- How do I change my plan?
- How do I cancel?
- Can I get a refund?

## Features
- How do I use [feature]?
- What are the limits?

## Troubleshooting
- Why isn't [feature] working?
- Common error messages
```

**Knowledge base principles:**
- Write for beginners
- Include screenshots
- Keep articles focused (one topic each)
- Update when product changes
- Track which articles get most views

### Step 2: Set Up Async Support

**Email support best practices:**

| Practice | Standard |
|----------|----------|
| Response time (Free) | 24-48 hours |
| Response time (Paid) | 4-24 hours |
| Response time (Enterprise) | 1-4 hours |
| First response | Acknowledge + timeline |
| Resolution time | Track and improve |

**Email templates:**

**Acknowledgment:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out. I've received your message about [topic].

I'll look into this and get back to you within [timeframe].

Quick question to help me help you faster: [clarifying question]

```

**Resolution:**
```

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

Let me know if this helps or if you have other questions.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Step 3: Handle Live Support

**When to offer live support:**

| Situation | Live Support? |
|-----------|---------------|
| Free users | No (async only) |
| Paid users (low tier) | Chat during hours |
| Paid users (high tier) | Chat + calls |
| Enterprise | Dedicated support |
| Urgent issues | Yes (any tier) |

**Live chat setup:**

- Set availability hours clearly
- Use chatbot for off-hours routing
- Have canned responses ready
- Set expectations on response time

### Step 4: Create Support Processes

**Ticket categorization:**

| Category | Priority | Response |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Bug - blocking | Critical | Immediate |
| Bug - non-blocking | High | 4 hours |
| How-to question | Medium | 24 hours |
| Feature request | Low | 48 hours |
| General feedback | Low | 48 hours |

**Escalation path:**

```
Level 1: Self-service (docs, FAQ)
Level 2: Standard support (email/chat)
Level 3: Technical escalation (you)
Level 4: Emergency (product down)
```

**Resolution tracking:**

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| First response time | < 4 hours | Shows attentiveness |
| Resolution time | < 24 hours | Customer satisfaction |
| First contact resolution | > 70% | Efficiency |
| CSAT score | > 4.5/5 | Quality |
| Tickets per customer | Decreasing | Product improvement |

### Step 5: Turn Support into Product Insights

**Feedback loop:**

```
Support ticket → Categorize → Pattern found → Product improvement
```

**Track patterns:**
- Same question asked 5+ times? → Add to FAQ
- Same bug reported? → Prioritize fix
- Feature requested often? → Add to roadmap
- Confusion point? → Improve onboarding
