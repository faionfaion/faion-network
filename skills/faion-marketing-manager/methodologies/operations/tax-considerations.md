## Problem

You're making money, but you're not thinking about taxes. You haven't set aside anything for tax payments. You don't know what you can deduct. When tax time comes, you're scrambling and paying more than necessary.

Tax planning means understanding your obligations and legally minimizing what you owe.

---

## Framework

Tax management follows this approach:

```
STRUCTURE   -> Business entity and tax treatment
TRACK       -> Record income and expenses
DEDUCT      -> Claim legitimate deductions
ESTIMATE    -> Pay quarterly estimates
PLAN        -> Optimize for next year
```

### Step 1: Understand Your Tax Situation

**Tax types for solopreneurs:**

| Tax | What It Is | Rate |
|-----|------------|------|
| **Income tax** | Federal tax on profit | 10-37% (brackets) |
| **Self-employment tax** | Social Security + Medicare | 15.3% |
| **State income tax** | State tax on income | 0-13% (varies) |
| **Sales tax** | Tax on sales (if applicable) | Varies by state |

**Self-employment tax breakdown:**
```
Self-employment tax = 15.3%
- Social Security: 12.4% (on first ~$160K)
- Medicare: 2.9% (no limit)
- Additional Medicare: 0.9% (over $200K)
```

**Effective tax rate example:**
```
Net profit: $100,000

Self-employment tax: $14,130 (15.3% x 92.35%)
Federal income tax: ~$15,000 (after deductions)
State tax: ~$5,000 (5% state)

Total: ~$34,000 (34% effective rate)
```

### Step 2: Choose Tax-Efficient Structure

**Entity tax treatment:**

| Entity | How Taxed | SE Tax? | Best For |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Sole Prop** | Personal return | Yes | Simple, low income |
| **LLC (default)** | Personal return | Yes | Most solopreneurs |
| **LLC (S-Corp)** | Salary + distributions | Partially | $80K+ profit |
| **S-Corp** | Salary + distributions | Partially | $80K+ profit |

**S-Corp election benefit:**
```
Without S-Corp (LLC default):
$100K profit → $15.3K SE tax

With S-Corp election:
$50K salary → $7.65K SE tax
$50K distribution → $0 SE tax
Savings: ~$7,650/year

(Must pay reasonable salary)
```

**When to consider S-Corp:**
- Consistent profit over $80K
- Willing to do payroll
- Can justify reasonable salary
- Worth the added complexity

### Step 3: Track Deductible Expenses

**Common deductions:**

| Category | Examples | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Home office** | Rent, utilities, internet | Dedicated space required |
| **Equipment** | Computer, monitors, phone | Can depreciate or Section 179 |
| **Software** | Tools, subscriptions | Business use only |
| **Marketing** | Ads, content, design | Keep receipts |
| **Professional services** | Legal, accounting | Business related |
| **Education** | Courses, books | Related to business |
| **Travel** | Business trips | Must be business purpose |
| **Health insurance** | Premiums | Self-employed deduction |
| **Retirement** | SEP-IRA, Solo 401k | Reduces taxable income |

**Home office deduction:**

**Simplified method:**
```
$5 per square foot, up to 300 sq ft
Max: $1,500 deduction
```

**Actual expense method:**
```
Home office: 200 sq ft
Total home: 2,000 sq ft
Business use: 10%

Rent: $2,000/mo x 10% = $200
Utilities: $200/mo x 10% = $20
Internet: $100/mo x 100% = $100 (if business essential)

Monthly deduction: $320
Annual: $3,840
```

### Step 4: Pay Quarterly Estimates

**Who must pay:**
- Expected to owe $1,000+ in taxes
- Applies to most profitable solopreneurs

**Due dates:**
| Quarter | Period | Due Date |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Q1 | Jan-Mar | April 15 |
| Q2 | Apr-May | June 15 |
| Q3 | Jun-Aug | September 15 |
| Q4 | Sep-Dec | January 15 |

**Calculation methods:**

**Safe harbor (avoid penalties):**
```
Pay 100% of last year's tax liability
(110% if income > $150K)
```

**Current year method:**
```
Estimate current year profit
Calculate tax
Pay 25% per quarter
```

**Simple approach:**
```
Set aside 25-30% of profit
Transfer to savings quarterly
Pay estimates from savings
```

### Step 5: Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts

**Retirement options:**

| Account | Contribution Limit | Best For |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **SEP-IRA** | 25% of net, up to ~$66K | Simple, high income |
| **Solo 401k** | $22.5K + 25% of net | Catch-up, Roth option |
| **Traditional IRA** | $6.5K | Additional savings |
| **Roth IRA** | $6.5K | Tax-free growth |

**SEP-IRA example:**
```
Net self-employment income: $100,000
Maximum contribution: ~$18,500 (special calculation)
Tax savings at 24% bracket: $4,440
```

**Health savings account (HSA):**
```
High-deductible health plan required
2024 limit: $4,150 (individual), $8,300 (family)
Triple tax benefit: deduction + growth + withdrawal
```
