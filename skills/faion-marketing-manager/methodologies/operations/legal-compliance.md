## Problem

You're building a business, but you're ignoring the legal side. No terms of service, no privacy policy, no proper business entity. You're exposing yourself to liability, fines, and potential shutdown.

Legal compliance means protecting yourself and your business while building trust with customers.

---

## Framework

Legal compliance covers these areas:

```
STRUCTURE   -> Business entity and registration
POLICIES    -> Terms, privacy, disclaimers
CONTRACTS   -> Customer and partner agreements
DATA        -> Privacy and data protection
IP          -> Intellectual property protection
```

### Step 1: Choose Business Structure

**Entity options:**

| Entity | Liability Protection | Taxes | Best For |
|--------|---------------------|-------|----------|
| **Sole Proprietorship** | None | Personal | Testing ideas |
| **LLC** | Yes | Pass-through | Most solopreneurs |
| **S-Corp** | Yes | Salary + distributions | $100K+ income |
| **C-Corp** | Yes | Corporate | Raising investment |

**LLC recommendation for most solopreneurs:**
- Personal liability protection
- Simple taxation (pass-through)
- Credibility with customers
- Flexible structure

**Formation steps:**
1. Choose state (home state or Delaware/Wyoming)
2. File articles of organization
3. Get EIN from IRS
4. Open business bank account
5. Register for state taxes if needed

### Step 2: Create Essential Policies

**Required for most online businesses:**

| Policy | What It Covers | Why Required |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Terms of Service** | User rules, liabilities | Limits your liability |
| **Privacy Policy** | Data collection and use | Legally required |
| **Cookie Policy** | Cookie usage | GDPR/CCPA compliance |
| **Refund Policy** | Return and refund terms | Customer clarity |

**Terms of Service essentials:**

```markdown
## Key Sections

1. **Acceptance of Terms**
   - Using the service means agreeing

2. **Description of Service**
   - What you provide

3. **User Responsibilities**
   - Acceptable use
   - Account security

4. **Payment Terms**
   - Pricing, billing, cancellation

5. **Intellectual Property**
   - Who owns what

6. **Disclaimers**
   - No warranties
   - Limitation of liability

7. **Termination**
   - How either party can end

8. **Governing Law**
   - Which jurisdiction applies
```

**Privacy Policy essentials:**

```markdown
## Key Sections

1. **Information Collected**
   - What data you collect
   - How you collect it

2. **Use of Information**
   - Why you collect data
   - How you use it

3. **Data Sharing**
   - Third parties you share with
   - Why you share

4. **Data Retention**
   - How long you keep data

5. **User Rights**
   - Access, correction, deletion
   - GDPR/CCPA rights

6. **Security**
   - How you protect data

7. **Contact**
   - How to reach you
```

### Step 3: Understand Key Regulations

**Major privacy regulations:**

| Regulation | Applies To | Key Requirements |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| **GDPR** | EU users | Consent, data rights, DPO |
| **CCPA/CPRA** | California users | Disclosure, opt-out, access |
| **CAN-SPAM** | US email marketing | Unsubscribe, accurate headers |
| **COPPA** | Children under 13 | Parental consent |

**GDPR compliance checklist:**
- [ ] Privacy policy explains data use
- [ ] Consent for non-essential cookies
- [ ] Data processing agreement with vendors
- [ ] Respond to access/deletion requests
- [ ] Report breaches within 72 hours

**CAN-SPAM compliance:**
- [ ] Don't use deceptive subject lines
- [ ] Include physical address
- [ ] Working unsubscribe link
- [ ] Honor opt-outs within 10 days

### Step 4: Protect Intellectual Property

**IP types:**

| Type | What It Protects | How to Get |
|------|------------------|------------|
| **Trademark** | Names, logos, slogans | Registration (USPTO) |
| **Copyright** | Creative works | Automatic (registration optional) |
| **Patent** | Inventions | Application (expensive) |
| **Trade Secret** | Confidential info | Keep it secret |

**Trademark priorities:**
1. Company name
2. Product name
3. Logo
4. Tagline (if distinctive)

**Before launch:**
- Search USPTO for conflicts
- Search domain availability
- Check social media handles
- Consider trademark registration

### Step 5: Contract Essentials

**Contracts you may need:**

| Contract | When to Use | Key Terms |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Customer agreement** | Selling services | Scope, payment, liability |
| **Contractor agreement** | Hiring help | IP assignment, confidentiality |
| **NDA** | Sharing confidential info | Definition, duration, exclusions |
| **Affiliate agreement** | Partnership referrals | Commission, terms, compliance |

**Contractor agreement essentials:**
- Work is "work for hire" (you own it)
- IP assignment clause
- Confidentiality clause
- Independent contractor status
- Payment terms
