## Problem

You're acquiring customers, but they keep leaving. Every churned customer costs you the acquisition spend plus all future revenue. At 5% monthly churn, you lose half your customers every year. Reducing churn from 5% to 3% can double your customer lifetime value.

Churn prevention means identifying why customers leave and stopping them before they do.

---

## Framework

Churn prevention follows this approach:

```
MEASURE   -> Know your churn rate and patterns
IDENTIFY  -> Find leading indicators
SEGMENT   -> Understand who churns and why
INTERVENE -> Act before they leave
RECOVER   -> Win back churned customers
```

### Step 1: Measure Churn

**Churn types:**

| Type | Definition | Formula |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Customer churn** | Customers who left | Lost / Starting customers |
| **Revenue churn** | Revenue lost | Lost MRR / Starting MRR |
| **Logo churn** | Accounts lost | Same as customer churn |
| **Net revenue retention** | Revenue including expansion | (Start + Expansion - Churn) / Start |

**Churn benchmarks:**

| Business Type | Monthly Churn | Annual Churn |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Consumer SaaS | 5-7% | 45-60% |
| SMB SaaS | 3-5% | 30-45% |
| Mid-market | 1-2% | 10-20% |
| Enterprise | <1% | <10% |

**Calculate your churn:**
```
Monthly churn = Customers lost this month / Customers at start of month

Annual churn = 1 - (1 - monthly churn)^12
Example: 5% monthly = 1 - (0.95)^12 = 46% annual
```

### Step 2: Identify Warning Signs

**Leading indicators of churn:**

| Indicator | Signal | Risk Level |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Login frequency | Decreasing logins | Medium |
| Feature usage | Using fewer features | High |
| Support tickets | Frustrated requests | High |
| Payment failures | Card declining | High |
| No engagement | Zero usage 14+ days | Critical |
| Feedback | Negative surveys | High |

**Build a health score:**

```
Health Score = (
  Login frequency (0-25) +
  Feature usage (0-25) +
  Support sentiment (0-25) +
  Account age (0-25)
) / 100

< 40 = At-risk
40-70 = Needs attention
> 70 = Healthy
```

### Step 3: Segment Churn Reasons

**Common churn reasons:**

| Reason | % of Churn | Preventable? |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Not using product | 25-30% | Yes |
| Not seeing value | 20-25% | Yes |
| Switched to competitor | 15-20% | Sometimes |
| Budget/price | 15-20% | Partially |
| Business closed | 5-10% | No |
| Bad support experience | 5-10% | Yes |

**Churn survey:**
```markdown
We're sorry to see you go. To help us improve, could you share why?

- [ ] I wasn't using it enough
- [ ] It's too expensive
- [ ] Missing features I need
- [ ] Found a better alternative
- [ ] My needs changed
- [ ] Technical issues
- [ ] Other: [text field]
```

### Step 4: Intervene Early

**Intervention strategies by signal:**

| Signal | Intervention |
|--------|--------------|
| No login 7 days | Re-engagement email |
| No login 14 days | Personal outreach |
| Feature drop-off | "Did you know?" email |
| Support complaint | Manager follow-up |
| Cancel attempt | Save offer |
| Payment failure | Dunning sequence |

**Re-engagement email:**
```
Subject: We miss you, [Name]

Haven't seen you in a while. Is everything okay?

A few things you might have missed:
- [New feature]
- [Popular use case]

Need help? Just reply to this email.

[Your name]
```

**Save offer (at cancellation):**
```
Before you go...

We'd hate to lose you. How about:
- [ ] 50% off your next 2 months
- [ ] Free upgrade to [plan] for 1 month
- [ ] Pause your account for 30 days
- [ ] Schedule a call to discuss your needs

[Accept offer] [Continue cancellation]
```

### Step 5: Recover Churned Customers

**Win-back timing:**

| Time Since Churn | Message Focus | Offer |
|------------------|---------------|-------|
| 7 days | "Miss us?" | Extended trial |
| 30 days | "What's changed" | Discount |
| 90 days | New features | Fresh start |
| 6 months | Major update | Special offer |

**Win-back email:**
```
Subject: A lot has changed since you left

- Added [feature they requested]
- Fixed [issue they had]
- Improved [relevant area]
