## Problem

Your customers bought your product, but are they successful? If they're not getting value, they'll churn. Support is reactive - fixing problems after they happen. Customer success is proactive - helping customers succeed before problems arise.

Customer success means ensuring customers achieve their goals with your product.

---

## Framework

Customer success follows this approach:

```
DEFINE    -> What does success look like?
MEASURE   -> Track customer health
ENGAGE    -> Proactive touchpoints
ENABLE    -> Provide resources for success
EXPAND    -> Grow successful customers
```

### Step 1: Define Customer Success

**Success metrics by product type:**

| Product Type | Success = | Metric |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| SaaS tool | Using core features | Feature adoption |
| Course | Completing content | Completion rate |
| Service | Achieving outcome | Results delivered |
| Membership | Engaging regularly | Engagement score |

**Customer success definition:**

```markdown
Our customers are successful when they:
1. [Primary outcome]
2. [Secondary outcome]
3. [Leading indicator]

Measured by:
- [Metric 1]: Target [X]
- [Metric 2]: Target [X]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
Project management SaaS:
Success = Teams actively using tool for project tracking

Measured by:
- Active projects: 3+ per team
- Daily active users: 50%+ of seats
- Tasks completed: 10+ per user/week
```

### Step 2: Build Health Scoring

**Health score components:**

| Component | Weight | Data Source |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Product usage | 30% | Analytics |
| Feature adoption | 25% | Analytics |
| Support sentiment | 20% | Support tickets |
| Engagement | 15% | Email, activity |
| Payment health | 10% | Billing |

**Scoring example:**

```
Usage Score (0-30):
- Daily active: 30
- Weekly active: 20
- Monthly active: 10
- Inactive: 0

Feature Score (0-25):
- Using all core features: 25
- Using most: 20
- Using some: 10
- Using few: 5

Support Score (0-20):
- Positive interactions: 20
- Neutral: 15
- Negative: 5
- Escalated: 0

Health Score = Usage + Feature + Support + Engagement + Payment
```

**Health categories:**

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 80-100 | Healthy | Maintain, upsell |
| 60-79 | Stable | Monitor, engage |
| 40-59 | At-risk | Intervene |
| 0-39 | Critical | Urgent outreach |

### Step 3: Create Success Touchpoints

**Proactive engagement:**

| Timing | Touchpoint | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Day 1 | Welcome | Set expectations |
| Day 3 | Check-in | Early issues |
| Day 7 | Progress | First value |
| Day 14 | Feature | Deeper engagement |
| Day 30 | Review | Success check |
| Monthly | Newsletter | Value, updates |
| Quarterly | Review | Strategic alignment |

**Automated touchpoints:**

```
Trigger: New customer
→ Day 1: Welcome email + resources
→ Day 3: "Need help?" check-in
→ Day 7: Feature tip
→ Day 14: Usage review

Trigger: Low usage (no login 7 days)
→ Immediate: Re-engagement email
→ Day 3: Personal outreach
→ Day 7: Escalate
```

**High-touch vs. low-touch:**

| Customer Type | Approach | Touchpoints |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Enterprise | High-touch | Dedicated success manager |
| Mid-market | Medium | Periodic calls + automation |
| SMB | Low-touch | Mostly automated |
| Self-serve | Tech-touch | Fully automated |

### Step 4: Enable Success

**Success resources:**

| Resource | Purpose | Format |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Onboarding guide | Get started quickly | Doc, video |
| Best practices | Optimal usage | Blog, guide |
| Templates | Quick wins | Download |
| Webinars | Deep learning | Live, recorded |
| Community | Peer support | Forum, Slack |
| Office hours | Live help | Scheduled calls |

**Self-service enablement:**

├── Core features
├── Advanced features
├── Integrations
├── Best practices
└── Troubleshooting

Video library:

```

### Step 5: Drive Expansion

```
