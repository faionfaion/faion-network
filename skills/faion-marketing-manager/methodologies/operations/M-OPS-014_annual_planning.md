## Problem

You're building day-to-day without a bigger picture. No annual goals, no roadmap, no strategy. Each year ends and you're not sure what you accomplished or where you're going.

Annual planning means setting a clear direction for the year so every day's work compounds toward your goals.

---

## Framework

Annual planning follows this process:

```
REFLECT   -> Review the past year
ENVISION  -> Define where you want to be
STRATEGIZE -> Choose how to get there
PLAN      -> Break into actionable goals
EXECUTE   -> Track and adjust throughout the year
```

### Step 1: Reflect on the Past Year

**Year in review:**

| Area | Questions |
|------|-----------|
| Revenue | How much did you make? Growth? |
| Customers | How many? Who are the best? |
| Product | What shipped? What didn't? |
| Marketing | What worked? What didn't? |
| Operations | What's efficient? What's broken? |
| Personal | Energy, satisfaction, burnout? |

**Wins and lessons:**

```markdown
## Year Review: [Year]

### Biggest Wins
1. [Win 1] - Why it mattered
2. [Win 2] - Why it mattered
3. [Win 3] - Why it mattered

### Biggest Challenges
1. [Challenge 1] - What you learned
2. [Challenge 2] - What you learned
3. [Challenge 3] - What you learned

### What Surprised You
- [Surprise 1]
- [Surprise 2]

### What You'd Do Differently
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]
```

**Metrics review:**

| Metric | Start of Year | End of Year | Change |
|--------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Revenue | $X | $X | +X% |
| Customers | X | X | +X |
| MRR | $X | $X | +X% |
| Products | X | X | +X |

### Step 2: Set Your Vision

**Where do you want to be in 12 months?**

| Area | Current | 12-Month Target |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Revenue | $X | $X |
| Customers | X | X |
| Products | X | X |
| Team | X | X |
| Lifestyle | [Description] | [Description] |

**Vision statement:**

```markdown
By December [Year], I will have:
- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]
- [Outcome 3]

This matters because:
[Why these goals]

Success feels like:
[Vivid description]
```

### Step 3: Identify Strategic Priorities

**Focus areas:**

| Priority | Why Important | Impact |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| 1. [Priority] | [Reason] | [Expected impact] |
| 2. [Priority] | [Reason] | [Expected impact] |
| 3. [Priority] | [Reason] | [Expected impact] |

**Maximum 3 major priorities.** More than 3 means nothing is a priority.

**Strategic questions:**
- What's the biggest constraint on growth?
- What would 10x the business?
- What should you stop doing?
- What should you start doing?
- What should you do more of?

### Step 4: Set Quarterly Goals

**Annual goals → Quarterly milestones:**

| Quarter | Theme | Key Results |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Q1 | Foundation | [Result 1], [Result 2] |
| Q2 | Growth | [Result 1], [Result 2] |
| Q3 | Scale | [Result 1], [Result 2] |
| Q4 | Optimize | [Result 1], [Result 2] |

**OKR format (optional):**

```markdown
## Q1 OKRs

### Objective 1: [Big goal]
- KR1: [Measurable result] (Target: X)
- KR2: [Measurable result] (Target: X)
- KR3: [Measurable result] (Target: X)

### Objective 2: [Big goal]
- KR1: [Measurable result] (Target: X)
- KR2: [Measurable result] (Target: X)
```

### Step 5: Create Action Plans

**Quarterly → Monthly → Weekly:**

```
Q1 Goal: Launch new product line
├── January: Research and design
│   ├── Week 1: Customer interviews
│   ├── Week 2: Competitor analysis
│   ├── Week 3: Product spec
│   └── Week 4: Design mockups
├── February: Build MVP
│   ├── Week 1-2: Core features
│   ├── Week 3: Testing
│   └── Week 4: Polish
└── March: Launch
    ├── Week 1: Soft launch
    ├── Week 2: Feedback and iterate
    ├── Week 3: Marketing push
    └── Week 4: Review and optimize
```

### Step 6: Build Review Rhythm

**Cadence:**

| Frequency | Focus | Duration |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Weekly | Task progress | 30 min |
| Monthly | Goal progress | 2 hours |
| Quarterly | Strategic review | Half day |
| Annually | Full planning | 1-2 days |

**Monthly review:**
- Are we on track for quarterly goals?
- What needs adjustment?
- What's the focus for next month?

**Quarterly review:**
- Did we hit the quarter's goals?
- What did we learn?
- Do annual goals need adjusting?
- Set next quarter's plan
