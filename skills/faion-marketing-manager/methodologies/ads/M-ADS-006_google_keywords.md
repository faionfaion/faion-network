## Problem

You're targeting the wrong keywords. Broad keywords waste budget on irrelevant clicks. Too narrow and you miss opportunities. Understanding keyword match types and intent is crucial for profitable campaigns.

The right keyword strategy balances reach with relevance.

---

## Framework

Keyword strategy follows the intent-first approach:

```
RESEARCH  -> Find keywords your audience uses
QUALIFY   -> Match keywords to intent
ORGANIZE  -> Group by theme
MATCH     -> Choose appropriate match types
REFINE    -> Add negatives, optimize
```

### Step 1: Keyword Research

**Research sources:**

| Source | How to Use |
|--------|------------|
| Google Keyword Planner | Search volume, competition |
| Google Search | Autocomplete suggestions |
| Competitor ads | What they're bidding on |
| Your site search | What users look for |
| Customer language | How they describe problems |
| SEO tools | Ahrefs, SEMrush keyword data |

**Using Keyword Planner:**
1. Tools & Settings → Planning → Keyword Planner
2. "Discover new keywords"
3. Enter seed keywords or URL
4. Filter by volume, competition
5. Export relevant keywords

**Keyword types to find:**
- Product/service keywords
- Problem keywords
- Comparison keywords
- Alternative keywords
- Competitor keywords
- Long-tail variations

### Step 2: Understand Keyword Intent

**Intent categories:**

| Intent | Signals | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Navigational** | Brand names | "[company] login" |
| **Informational** | How, what, why | "how to manage projects" |
| **Commercial** | Best, top, compare | "best project management tool" |
| **Transactional** | Buy, pricing, trial | "project management software pricing" |

**Intent value hierarchy:**
```
High value: Transactional → Commercial → Informational → Navigational
```

**Focus budget on transactional and commercial first.**

### Step 3: Match Types

**Match type options:**

| Match Type | Syntax | Triggers |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **Broad** | keyword | Related searches, synonyms |
| **Phrase** | "keyword" | Searches containing phrase |
| **Exact** | [keyword] | Exactly or close variants |

**When to use each:**

| Match Type | Use Case | Risk |
|------------|----------|------|
| Broad | Discovery, high budget | Irrelevant traffic |
| Phrase | Balance reach/relevance | Some irrelevant |
| Exact | Proven keywords, tight control | Limited reach |

**Starting strategy:**
```
1. Start with phrase match
2. Add exact match for top performers
3. Use broad sparingly with tight negatives
```

### Step 4: Keyword Organization

**Ad group structure:**

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **SKAG** | Single Keyword Ad Groups (tight) |
| **Themed** | Related keywords grouped |
| **Funnel** | By intent stage |

**Themed approach (recommended):**
```
Ad Group: Project Management Tools
├── "project management software"
├── "project management tool"
├── "project management app"
├── [project management platform]
└── [team project management]

Ad Group: Task Management
├── "task management software"
├── "task tracking tool"
└── [task management app]
```

**Rules:**
- 10-20 keywords per ad group
- All keywords share same intent
- Ads match keyword theme
- Separate match types (optional)

### Step 5: Negative Keywords

**Negative keywords prevent wasted spend:**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Unqualified** | free, cheap, DIY |
| **Wrong intent** | jobs, careers, salary |
| **Wrong product** | unrelated products |
| **Competitors** | (if not targeting) |
| **Wrong audience** | students, hobbyists |

**Negative match types:**
- Negative broad: blocks if any word matches
- Negative phrase: blocks if phrase appears
- Negative exact: blocks exact match only

**Build negative list:**
1. Review Search Terms report weekly
2. Add irrelevant searches as negatives
3. Create shared negative lists
4. Apply across campaigns

### Step 6: Ongoing Optimization

**Weekly keyword tasks:**

| Task | How |
|------|-----|
| Review Search Terms | Find new negatives, keyword ideas |
| Check Quality Scores | Improve low QS keywords |
| Adjust bids | Based on performance |
| Add new keywords | From Search Terms insights |
| Pause poor performers | High cost, no conversions |

**Quality Score factors:**
- Expected CTR
- Ad relevance
- Landing page experience

**Improve Quality Score:**
- Use keyword in ad copy
- Match landing page to keyword
- Improve CTR through better ads
- Create tighter ad groups
