## Problem

Your targeting is perfect but ads don't convert. People scroll past without stopping. Your click-through rate is below 1%. Creative is the most important factor in ad performance, yet most spend 90% of their time on targeting.

Great creative stops the scroll, communicates value, and drives action in seconds.

---

## Framework

Ad creative follows the AIDA pattern:

```
ATTENTION -> Stop the scroll (visual + hook)
INTEREST  -> Engage them (relevance)
DESIRE    -> Create want (benefits, proof)
ACTION    -> Drive click (CTA)
```

### Step 1: Understand Ad Formats

**Format comparison:**

| Format | Best For | Specs |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Static image** | Simple messages | 1080x1080 (1:1) or 1080x1920 (9:16) |
| **Video** | Storytelling, demos | 15-30 sec, vertical or square |
| **Carousel** | Multiple products/benefits | 2-10 images, 1080x1080 |
| **Collection** | E-commerce | Instant Experience |
| **Stories/Reels** | Full-screen immersion | 1080x1920, 15 sec max |

**Format selection:**
- Start with static images (fastest to test)
- Add video once you find winning angles
- Use carousel for feature showcases

### Step 2: Create Scroll-Stopping Visuals

**Visual hierarchy:**
1. Hero image/video (main focus)
2. Key text (headline overlay)
3. Branding (subtle, not dominant)

**What works:**
- Faces with emotion
- Before/after contrasts
- Product in action
- Bold, contrasting colors
- Text overlays (but not too much)
- Motion in first 3 seconds (video)

**What doesn't work:**
- Stock photos (obviously fake)
- Too much text
- Busy compositions
- Low contrast
- Small products/faces

**The 3-second rule:**
- Video must hook in 3 seconds
- Image must communicate in 3 seconds
- If it doesn't stop scroll, nothing else matters

### Step 3: Write Compelling Copy

**Copy structure:**

| Element | Character Limit | Best Practice |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| Primary text | ~125 shown (more behind "See more") | Hook first, details second |
| Headline | ~40 | Benefit-focused, clear |
| Description | ~30 | Optional, supports headline |

**Hook formulas:**
```
Question hook:
"Tired of [problem]?"

Bold claim:
"We increased [metric] by 400%"

Curiosity:
"This simple change doubled our [result]"

Social proof:
"10,000+ [audience] are using this"

Direct benefit:
"Get [outcome] in [timeframe]"
```

**Primary text formula:**
```
[Hook - stop them]

[Pain point - empathize]

[Solution - introduce product]

[Benefit 1]
[Benefit 2]
[Benefit 3]

[Social proof]

[CTA]
```

### Step 4: Design for Placements

**Placement optimization:**

| Placement | Specs | Tips |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Feed | 1:1 or 4:5 | Can handle more text |
| Stories | 9:16 | Full screen, fast-paced |
| Reels | 9:16 | Native-looking, entertaining |
| Right column | 1:1 | Desktop only, simple |
| Search | 1:1 | Intent-based, direct |

**Asset requirements:**
- Create both 1:1 and 9:16 versions
- Use Advantage+ creative to auto-optimize
- Or manually select placements per format

### Step 5: Test Creative Systematically

**Testing framework:**
1. Test hooks first (biggest impact)
2. Then test visuals
3. Then test copy details
4. Then test formats

**Testing structure:**
```
Ad Set: [Audience]
├── Ad 1: Hook A + Visual A
├── Ad 2: Hook B + Visual A
├── Ad 3: Hook C + Visual A
├── Ad 4: Hook A + Visual B
└── Ad 5: Hook A + Visual C

Isolate variables to learn what works
```

**Minimum spend per creative:**
- $20-50 before judging
- 1,000+ impressions
- Statistical significance needed

### Step 6: Avoid Creative Fatigue

**Signs of fatigue:**
- Declining CTR over time
- Rising CPM
- Decreasing conversion rate
- Same audience, worse results

**Prevention:**
- Refresh creatives every 2-4 weeks
- Have 5-10 variations ready
- Iterate on winners (don't start from scratch)
- Test new angles continuously
