## Problem

You're selling B2B and need to reach decision-makers. LinkedIn has the professional targeting you need, but ads are expensive. CPCs of $5-15 are common. Without proper setup, you'll burn through budget fast.

LinkedIn ads work when you target precisely and provide genuine value. Generic campaigns fail quickly.

---

## Framework

LinkedIn advertising requires precision:

```
TARGET    -> Reach exact job titles and companies
CREATIVE  -> Professional, value-first content
CONVERT   -> Lead gen forms or high-value landing pages
```

### Step 1: Campaign Objectives

**Objective options:**

| Objective | Best For | Outcome |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Brand Awareness | Top of funnel | Impressions |
| Website Visits | Traffic | Clicks |
| Engagement | Content promotion | Reactions, comments |
| Video Views | Video content | Views |
| Lead Generation | Lead forms | Form submissions |
| Website Conversions | Signups, demos | Conversions |

**For most B2B: Start with Lead Generation or Website Conversions.**

### Step 2: Targeting Options

**LinkedIn's targeting advantage:**

| Targeting | Options |
|-----------|---------|
| **Job Title** | Exact titles or title functions |
| **Job Seniority** | Entry to C-level |
| **Company Size** | 1-10 to 10,000+ |
| **Company Name** | Specific companies (ABM) |
| **Industry** | 140+ industries |
| **Skills** | Professional skills |
| **Groups** | LinkedIn groups membership |
| **Interests** | Professional interests |

**Targeting strategies:**

| Strategy | Setup | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Broad** | Industry + Seniority | Awareness |
| **Function** | Job Function + Company Size | Roles |
| **ABM** | Company List + Job Titles | Named accounts |
| **Retargeting** | Website visitors | Warm audiences |

**Audience size:**
- Minimum: 50,000 for awareness
- Ideal for conversions: 20,000-100,000
- Too narrow = high costs, limited learning

### Step 3: Ad Formats

**Format comparison:**

| Format | Best For | Specs |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Single Image** | Standard promotion | 1200x627 |
| **Carousel** | Multiple products/features | 3-10 cards |
| **Video** | Storytelling, demos | 3-30 sec |
| **Text Ads** | Low budget awareness | Text only |
| **Message Ads** | Direct outreach | Sponsored InMail |
| **Lead Gen Forms** | Form submissions | Native forms |

**Lead Gen Forms advantage:**
- Pre-filled with LinkedIn data
- Higher conversion rates
- No landing page needed
- But lower intent than website forms

### Step 4: Create Ads

**Ad components:**

| Element | Limit | Best Practice |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Intro text | 150 chars shown | Hook + value |
| Headline | 70 chars | Clear benefit |
| Description | 100 chars | Supporting info |
| CTA | Predefined | Learn More, Sign Up, etc. |
| Image | 1200x627 | Professional, eye-catching |

**Copy formula for B2B:**
```
Intro: [Problem or question]
Headline: [Solution or value prop]
CTA: [Clear action]

Example:
Intro: "Still managing projects in spreadsheets?"
Headline: "Project Management Made Simple for Growing Teams"
CTA: Learn More
```

### Step 5: Budget and Bidding

**Cost expectations:**
- CPM: $30-80
- CPC: $5-15
- Cost per lead: $30-100+

**Budget recommendations:**
- Minimum: $50/day
- Recommended: $100+/day
- Test budget: $2,000-5,000 minimum

**Bidding options:**
- Maximum delivery (automatic)
- Cost cap (set target CPA)
- Manual CPC (full control)

**Start with:** Maximum delivery, then optimize to cost cap.

### Step 6: Optimization

**Key metrics:**

| Metric | Good | Great |
|--------|------|-------|
| CTR | 0.4% | 0.8%+ |
| Lead form rate | 10% | 15%+ |
| CPL | <$75 | <$50 |
| Lead quality | 30%+ qualified | 50%+ qualified |

**Optimization actions:**
- Refresh creative every 2-3 weeks
- Exclude converted leads
- Test audiences systematically
- Use retargeting for engaged users
