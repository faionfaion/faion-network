## Problem

Your ads have low Quality Score and poor CTR. Google rewards relevant, compelling ads with lower costs and better placements. But writing ads with character limits is challenging.

Great Google Ads copy matches user intent, differentiates from competitors, and drives action in limited space.

---

## Framework

Google ad creation follows relevance-first principles:

```
MATCH     -> Match ad to keyword intent
BENEFIT   -> Lead with value, not features
PROOF     -> Add credibility elements
ACTION    -> Clear call to action
```

### Step 1: Understand Ad Types

**Search ad formats:**

| Format | Components |
|--------|------------|
| **Responsive Search (RSA)** | 15 headlines, 4 descriptions |
| **Dynamic Search** | Auto-generated from site |
| **Call-only** | Phone call focus |

**RSA is the default.** Focus on mastering it first.

**RSA specifications:**

| Element | Character Limit | Shown |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Headlines | 30 chars each | Up to 3 |
| Descriptions | 90 chars each | Up to 2 |
| Display path | 15 chars x 2 | Always |
| Final URL | - | Landing page |

### Step 2: Write Headlines

**15 headlines, different angles:**

| Angle | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Keyword** | "Project Management Software" |
| **Benefit 1** | "Save 10 Hours Per Week" |
| **Benefit 2** | "Ship Projects Faster" |
| **Social proof** | "Trusted by 10,000+ Teams" |
| **CTA** | "Start Your Free Trial" |
| **Offer** | "Get 30% Off Today" |
| **Feature** | "Real-Time Collaboration" |
| **Differentiator** | "No Training Required" |
| **Urgency** | "Limited Time Offer" |
| **Question** | "Need Better Project Tracking?" |

**Headline best practices:**
- Include keyword in 2-3 headlines
- Use numbers (30%, 10K, 5 minutes)
- Mix benefits, proof, and CTAs
- Pin important headlines to position 1 or 2

### Step 3: Write Descriptions

**4 descriptions, different focuses:**

| Description # | Focus |
|---------------|-------|
| 1 | Expand on primary benefit + CTA |
| 2 | Features + proof |
| 3 | Problem + solution |
| 4 | Offer + urgency |

**Description formula:**
```
[Benefit statement]. [Supporting detail or proof]. [CTA].

Example:
"Manage projects effortlessly with our intuitive tools.
Join 10,000+ teams who ship faster. Try free for 14 days."
```

**Use all 90 characters when possible.**

### Step 4: Set Display Path

**Display path best practices:**

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Include keyword | example.com/Project-Management |
| Show benefit | example.com/Save-Time |
| Match landing page | example.com/Free-Trial |
| Category/product | example.com/Software/Teams |

**Note:** Display path doesn't need to match actual URL structure.

### Step 5: Ad Strength Optimization

**Ad strength factors:**
- Variety of headlines
- Keywords in headlines
- Unique headlines (not repetitive)
- Character utilization
- Popular headlines used

**Improve from "Poor" to "Excellent":**
1. Use all 15 headlines
2. Make each headline unique
3. Include keywords naturally
4. Use full character count
5. Test different angles

### Step 6: Ad Variations by Theme

**Create variations per ad group:**

```
Ad Group: [Theme A]
├── RSA 1: Focus on benefit A
├── RSA 2: Focus on social proof
└── RSA 3: Focus on offer

Ad Group: [Theme B]
├── RSA 1: Focus on benefit B
├── RSA 2: Focus on comparison
└── RSA 3: Focus on speed/ease
```
