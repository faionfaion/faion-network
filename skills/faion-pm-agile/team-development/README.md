## Examples

### Example 1: Navigating Storming Stage

**Symptoms:**
- Developer A and B argue about architecture
- Meetings get heated
- Work slows down

**PM Actions:**
1. Meet with A and B separately to understand perspectives
2. Facilitate structured discussion with ground rules
3. Focus on shared goals, not positions
4. Document agreed-upon decision
5. Monitor for continued conflict

### Example 2: Solo to Team Transition

For solopreneurs hiring first team member:

```markdown
## First Hire Integration Plan

Week 1: Orientation
- [ ] Share vision and values
- [ ] Walk through codebase
- [ ] Explain current processes
- [ ] Define initial responsibilities

Week 2-4: Gradual Ownership
- [ ] Pair on first tasks
- [ ] Review their work thoroughly
- [ ] Give direct, kind feedback
- [ ] Discuss what's working

Month 2: Independence
- [ ] Let them own features end-to-end
- [ ] Reduce pair time, increase review
- [ ] Ask for their process improvements
- [ ] Celebrate first solo ship

Key: Document everything, assume nothing
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Skipping team building** - "No time" creates dysfunction later
2. **Ignoring storming** - Conflict doesn't resolve itself
3. **One-size-fits-all management** - Different people need different approaches
4. **No skills development** - Team stagnates, people leave
5. **Blaming individuals** - Usually it's a system/process problem
