# AI in Project Management

## Project Management Framework 8 AI Appendix

First dedicated coverage of AI in Project Management Framework. Addresses ethical technology use, AI-assisted decisions, and sustainable project delivery.

**AI Applications:**

| Area | AI Application | Adoption Rate (2024) |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Risk Management** | Predictive risk identification, probability forecasting | 54% |
| **Task Automation** | Routine task handling, workflow automation | 53% |
| **Predictive Analysis** | Outcome forecasting, trend detection | 52% |
| **Schedule Optimization** | Timeline prediction, dependency analysis | 52% |
| **Resource Planning** | Capacity forecasting, skill matching | 47% |

**The AI Productivity Paradox (DORA 2025):**
- AI coding assistants boost individual output (21% more tasks, 98% more PRs)
- But organizational delivery metrics stay flat
- Bottlenecks shift to review, integration, and deployment
- Need end-to-end visibility via Value Stream Management

**Implementation Approach:**
```
1. Start with low-risk, high-value AI use cases
2. Maintain human oversight for decisions
3. Validate AI recommendations
4. Document AI-assisted decisions
5. Build team AI literacy
6. Monitor for shifted bottlenecks
```

**Industry Results:**
- 96% prediction accuracy (Intelligent Project Prediction tool)
- 15% reduction in budget overruns (Acciona)
- 84% improved efficiency (Project.co survey)
