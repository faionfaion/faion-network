## Problem

Traditional process-based project management can feel mechanical and disconnected from outcomes. Teams follow steps without understanding why. Projects succeed on process metrics but fail on value delivery. The connection between activities and results is unclear.

Project Management Framework 7th Edition addresses this with Performance Domains - areas where project managers must achieve results, not just follow processes.

## Framework

### What are Performance Domains?

Performance Domains are interconnected areas of project work that together enable successful project delivery. They focus on outcomes rather than processes.

### The 8 Performance Domains

```
+------------------+     +------------------+
|   Stakeholder    |     |      Team        |
|   Performance    |<--->|   Performance    |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Treating domains as sequential** - They are concurrent and interconnected
2. **Focusing on one domain** - All domains need attention
3. **Process over outcomes** - Domains are about results, not activities
4. **Ignoring interactions** - Domains affect each other
5. **One-time assessment** - Regular review needed

---

## Domain Interactions

| If This Domain Struggles | These May Be Affected |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Stakeholder | Team, Delivery, Measurement |
| Team | Project Work, Delivery |
| Development Approach | Planning, Project Work, Delivery |
| Planning | Project Work, Delivery, Measurement |
| Project Work | Delivery, Measurement |
| Delivery | Stakeholder, Measurement |
| Measurement | All domains (poor visibility) |
| Uncertainty | All domains (unexpected impacts) |

---

## Next Steps

After understanding performance domains:
1. Assess your project across all domains
2. Identify weak areas needing attention
3. Apply relevant methodologies
4. Monitor domain health regularly
5. Balance attention across domains
