## AI-Enabled Business Analysis

### Problem

Traditional requirements gathering is manual, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency. Stakeholders struggle to articulate needs clearly. Document analysis takes excessive effort. AI capabilities are underutilized in BA workflows.

### Solution

Integrate AI tools into BA workflows for requirements extraction, document analysis, and decision support.

### Key Competencies for AI-Ready BAs

1. **AI Opportunity Identification** - Drive business case for AI adoption, identify relevant AI opportunities
2. **AI Requirements Specification** - Define business requirements specific to AI initiatives
3. **Trust, Risk, and Security Management** - Manage AI-specific concerns (bias, privacy, explainability)

### AI Application Areas

| Area | AI Capability | BA Benefit |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Requirements extraction | NLP, document analysis | Automated requirement identification from documents |
| Stakeholder analysis | Sentiment analysis | Understand stakeholder concerns from communications |
| Process discovery | Process mining | Data-driven process mapping |
| Decision support | Predictive analytics | Evidence-based prioritization |
| Documentation | GenAI | Accelerated document generation |

### Agentic AI Integration (2026)

By 2028, 40% of interactions with generative AI services will use action models and autonomous agents for task completion (Gartner).

**BA Role in Agentic Systems:**
- Define agent boundaries and decision rules
- Specify human oversight requirements
- Document escalation criteria
- Validate agent outputs against business rules

### AI TRiSM Framework

Gartner's AI TRiSM (Trust, Risk, and Security Management) helps ensure AI model governance, trustworthiness, fairness, reliability, robustness, efficacy, and data protection. Organizations applying this framework are expected to be 50% more successful in AI adoption by 2026.
