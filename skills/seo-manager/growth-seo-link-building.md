## Problem

You're creating great content but nobody finds it. Google ranks content with quality backlinks higher. Without links, even excellent content stays invisible. But link building feels sleazy - you've heard about buying links, PBNs, and other black-hat tactics.

Legitimate link building is about creating link-worthy content and building relationships. It takes longer but creates sustainable rankings.

---

## Framework

Effective link building follows value-first principles:

```
CREATE    -> Content worth linking to
IDENTIFY  -> Who would link and why
OUTREACH  -> Build relationships, earn links
MEASURE   -> Track results, iterate
```

### Step 1: Create Link-Worthy Content

**Content types that attract links:**

| Type | Description | Link Potential |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Original research** | Surveys, data analysis | Very High |
| **Ultimate guides** | Comprehensive resource | High |
| **Tools/calculators** | Free interactive tools | Very High |
| **Original graphics** | Infographics, charts | Medium |
| **Expert roundups** | Curated expert opinions | Medium |
| **Case studies** | Real results with data | Medium |
| **Industry benchmarks** | Data people reference | Very High |

**Link magnet formula:**
```
[Something journalists/bloggers need] + [That doesn't exist or is outdated]

Examples:
- "State of [Industry] 2026 Report"
- "Free [Tool] Calculator"
- "[Topic] Statistics and Trends"
- "The Complete Guide to [Emerging Topic]"
```

### Step 2: Find Link Opportunities

**Prospecting methods:**

| Method | How | Quality |
|--------|-----|---------|
| **Competitor analysis** | Who links to competitors? | High |
| **Resource page links** | "Resources" + [your topic] | High |
| **Broken link building** | Find broken links to replace | Medium |
| **Guest posting** | Write for other sites | Medium |
| **HARO/Qwoted** | Journalist requests | High |
| **Unlinked mentions** | Find mentions without links | High |
| **Skyscraper technique** | Improve on linked content | Medium |

**Tools for prospecting:**
- Ahrefs: Competitor backlinks, broken links
- Moz: Domain authority, link opportunities
- Hunter: Find email addresses
- Google: "[topic] + resources" searches

### Step 3: Outreach Templates

**The key principles:**
- Personalization is mandatory
- Explain why it benefits THEM
- Make the ask easy
- Follow up (once)

**Resource page outreach:**
```
Subject: Resource suggestion for [page title]

Hey [Name],

I was researching [topic] and found your resource page on [URL].
Great collection - I bookmarked it for reference.

I noticed you link to [similar resource]. We recently published
[your content title] which [unique value it provides].

It might be a good addition for your readers because [specific reason].

Here's the link: [URL]

Either way, thanks for putting together that resource list.

[Name]
```

**Broken link building:**
```
Subject: Broken link on [page title]

Hey [Name],

I was reading your article on [topic] and noticed a broken link
to [what it was supposed to link to].

The link: [URL]
The broken resource: [description]

I recently wrote [your content] which covers [similar topic].
It might work as a replacement: [URL]

Hope that helps!

[Name]
```

**Guest post pitch:**
```
Subject: Guest post idea for [Publication]

Hey [Name],

I've been reading [Publication] for a while - really enjoyed
your recent piece on [topic].

I'd love to contribute a post about [specific topic] because
[why their audience would care].

A few angles I could take:
- [Angle 1]
- [Angle 2]
- [Angle 3]

Here are some of my previous posts: [samples]

Would any of these work for [Publication]?

[Name]
```

### Step 4: Scale Outreach

**Process for volume:**

1. Build prospect list (100-500 sites)
2. Find contact info (Hunter, LinkedIn)
3. Personalize first line for each
4. Send in batches (50/day max)
5. Follow up after 7 days (once)
6. Track in spreadsheet

**Outreach cadence:**
```
Day 0: Initial outreach
Day 7: Follow-up if no response
Day 14+: Move to next batch
```

**Tracking template:**
```
| URL | Contact | Email | Sent | Response | Link? | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| ... | ...     | ...   | Date | Yes/No   | Yes/No| ...   |
```

### Step 5: Internal Linking

**Often overlooked, high impact:**

| Tactic | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| New to old | Link new posts to relevant old content |
| Old to new | Update old posts with links to new content |
| Pillar/cluster | Main topics link to subtopics and back |
| Anchor text | Use keyword-rich but natural anchors |
