## Problem

You spend money to acquire every new user. Paid acquisition is expensive and does not scale. You need users to bring other users automatically.

The viral coefficient (K-factor) measures how many new users each existing user brings. If K > 1, your product grows exponentially without spending on ads.

---

## Framework

### What is the Viral Coefficient?

The viral coefficient (K-factor) measures the average number of new users that each existing user generates.

```
K = i × c

Where:
i = number of invites sent per user
c = conversion rate of invites (% who sign up)
```

### K-factor Interpretation

| K-factor | Meaning | Growth Pattern |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| K < 0.5 | Weak virality | Slow organic growth |
| K = 0.5-1.0 | Good virality | Steady amplification |
| K = 1.0 | Break-even | Each user brings 1 new user |
| K > 1.0 | Viral | Exponential growth |
| K > 2.0 | Highly viral | Rapid exponential growth |

### The Viral Loop

```
1. USER JOINS
   New user experiences value
           ↓
2. TRIGGER
   User encounters share moment
           ↓
3. INVITATION
   User sends invite to friends
           ↓
4. CONVERSION
   Friend clicks and signs up
           ↓
5. REPEAT
   New user goes through same loop
```

---

## K-factor Calculation

### Basic Formula

```
K = Invites per User × Conversion Rate

Example:
- Average user sends 5 invites
- 20% of invitees sign up
- K = 5 × 0.20 = 1.0
```

### Extended Formula with Time

```
K(t) = (Users at time 0) × K^(t/cycle_time)

Where:
- cycle_time = average time from signup to invite conversion
```

### User Growth Projection

If you start with 1,000 users and K = 1.2:

| Cycle | Users | New from Viral | Total |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------|
| 0 | 1,000 | - | 1,000 |
| 1 | 1,000 | 1,200 | 2,200 |
| 2 | 2,200 | 2,640 | 4,840 |
| 3 | 4,840 | 5,808 | 10,648 |
| 4 | 10,648 | 12,778 | 23,426 |

With K > 1, growth becomes exponential.

## Components of Virality

### Factor 1: Invites Sent (i)

**How to increase invites per user:**

| Tactic | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Natural share moments | Prompt share when user achieves something | High |
| Referral incentives | Give rewards for inviting | Medium-High |
| Multi-channel invites | Email, SMS, social, copy link | Medium |
| Contact import | Make inviting easy with bulk import | Medium |
| Viral content | Create shareable content (results, badges) | High |
| Team features | Require others to use product | Very High |

### Factor 2: Conversion Rate (c)

**How to increase invite conversion:**

| Tactic | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Personal invitation | "John invited you" vs generic | High |
| Social proof | "5 of your friends use this" | High |
| Clear value prop | Why should they sign up? | High |
| Low friction signup | One-click, minimal fields | High |
| Incentive for invitee | "Get $10 when you join" | Medium |
| Preview value | Show what they will get | Medium |

---

## Types of Viral Loops

### 1. Word of Mouth (WOM)

Users naturally tell others about your product.

```
User → Tells friend → Friend signs up
```

**Examples:** Exceptional products (Notion, Figma)

**Characteristics:**
- Low i (not everyone tells)
- High c (strong recommendation)
- Typical K: 0.1-0.5

### 2. Inherent Virality

Product requires others to function.

```
User → Needs to collaborate → Invites colleague
```

**Examples:** Slack, Zoom, Figma, Google Docs

**Characteristics:**
- High i (must invite to use)
- High c (clear need)
- Typical K: 0.5-2.0

### 3. Artificial Virality (Incentivized)

Rewards for referrals.

```
User → Gets reward for inviting → Sends many invites
```

**Examples:** Dropbox, Uber, Airbnb

**Characteristics:**
- High i (motivated by reward)
- Lower c (less authentic)
- Typical K: 0.3-1.0

### 4. Content Virality

User-generated content spreads.

```
User → Creates content → Content shared → Viewer signs up
```

**Examples:** TikTok, YouTube, Instagram

**Characteristics:**
- Variable i (depends on content quality)
- Low c (many views, few signups)
- Typical K: 0.1-0.5

### 5. Outbreak Virality

Product spreads through networks.

```
User → Installs → Automatically invites contacts
```

**Examples:** Old Hotmail signature, early LinkedIn

**Characteristics:**
- Very high i (automated)
- Low c (impersonal)
- Can be seen as spam

## Improving Your K-factor

### Step 1: Measure Current K

Track these metrics:

| Metric | Description | How to Track |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Invites sent | Total invitations | Count invite events |
| Invites per user | Average i | Total invites / Active users |
| Invite clicks | Recipients who clicked | UTM tracking |
| Invite signups | Recipients who signed up | Referral attribution |
| Conversion rate | c = signups / invites sent | Calculate ratio |

### Step 2: Find Your Viral Loop Type

Which type fits your product?

| Product Type | Best Loop Type |
|--------------|----------------|
| Collaboration tool | Inherent |
| Consumer app | Content + WOM |
| Marketplace | Incentivized |
| Productivity tool | WOM + Inherent |
| Social network | Content + Inherent |

### Step 3: Optimize Invites (i)

**Identify share moments:**

1. Achievement (completed goal, milestone)
2. Discovery (found something great)
3. Social (want to connect with friend)
4. Help (need someone to use with)

**Create friction-free sharing:**

```
Bad: Navigate to settings → Find invite → Copy link → Paste
Good: [Share] button → One tap to send
```

### Step 4: Optimize Conversion (c)

**Landing page for invites:**

```
Good invite landing page:
1. [Avatar] John invited you to [Product]
2. "Join 50,000 people using [Product] to [benefit]"
3. [Sign up with Google] - one click
4. Preview of what they get
```

**Reduce friction:**

- Pre-fill email from invite
- One-click signup (Google, Apple)
- Show value before signup
- Mobile-optimized

### Referral Program Design

```markdown
# Referral Program Specification

## Incentive Structure

| Action | Referrer Gets | Invitee Gets |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Signup | - | $10 credit |
| First purchase | $20 credit | - |
| Becomes paid | $50 credit | - |

## Mechanics

1. User accesses "Refer a Friend" from dashboard
2. Gets unique link: yourapp.com/r/USERCODE
3. Shares via: email, SMS, social, copy link
4. Invitee clicks → lands on personalized page
5. Invitee signs up → both get credited

## Tracking

- Referral code in URL: ?ref=USERCODE
- Attribution window: 30 days
- Credit expiration: 90 days

## Fraud Prevention

- Max 50 referrals per user
- One referral credit per household
- Manual review for 10+ referrals/day
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Dropbox Referral Program

**The legendary referral program:**

```
Incentive: 500MB free storage for both parties

Results:
- i = 2.1 invites per user (avg)
- c = 35% conversion rate
- K = 0.735

Impact:
- 60% of signups came from referrals
- Grew from 100K to 4M users in 15 months
```

**Why it worked:**

1. Clear value (storage is tangible)
2. Two-sided incentive (both benefit)
3. Easy sharing (multiple channels)
4. Trusted (friend recommendation)

### Example 2: Slack Inherent Virality

**Built-in virality:**

```
Viral loop:
1. User joins team workspace
2. Needs to collaborate with colleague
3. Invites colleague to channel
4. Colleague invites their team

Results:
- Teams naturally expand
- Department → Company → Partners
- K > 1 within organizations
```

**Why it worked:**

1. Product requires others
2. Value increases with users
3. Low friction invite
4. Clear purpose for invite

### Example 3: PayPal Incentivized Referral

**Early growth hack:**

```
Incentive: $10 for referrer + $10 for new user

Results:
- Rapid user acquisition
- 7-10% daily growth at peak
- $60M spent on referrals

Cost calculation:
- CAC via referral: $20
- LTV: $300+
- ROI: 15x
```

**Lessons:**

1. Cash incentives work but are expensive
2. Must have high LTV to justify
3. Attracts some fraud
4. Good for cold start, reduce over time

### Example 4: Wordle Content Virality

**Viral through shareable content:**

```
Viral loop:
1. User plays game
2. Gets result (colored squares)
3. Shares result on Twitter
4. Friends see, want to play
5. Visit site, play, share

Virality mechanics:
- Universal format (everyone sees same puzzle)
- No spoilers (squares don't reveal answer)
- Social competition (compare with friends)
- Daily habit (same puzzle each day)
```

## Viral Loop Calculator

### Basic Calculator

```
INPUT:
- Users: 1,000
- Invites per user (i): ___
- Conversion rate (c): ___%
- Viral cycle time: ___ days

CALCULATE:
K = i × c = ___

PROJECTION (5 cycles):
Cycle 0: 1,000 users
Cycle 1: 1,000 + (1,000 × K) = ___ users
Cycle 2: ___ + (___ × K) = ___ users
...
```

### Break-even Analysis

```
To achieve K = 1.0:

If c = 10%, need i = 10 invites/user
If c = 20%, need i = 5 invites/user
If c = 30%, need i = 3.3 invites/user
If c = 50%, need i = 2 invites/user

Current state:
- i = ___
- c = ___
- Gap to K=1: ___
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Assuming K > 1 is easy | Very few products achieve this | Aim for K = 0.3-0.5 |
| Only counting referrals | Ignores other viral loops | Track all viral sources |
| Spam-like invite flow | Damages trust, annoys users | Natural share moments |
| Generic invite messages | Low conversion | Personal, contextual invites |
| One channel only | Misses preferences | Multi-channel sharing |
| No tracking | Cannot optimize | Attribute all referrals |
| Over-incentivizing | Attracts fraud, low quality | Balance incentives |
