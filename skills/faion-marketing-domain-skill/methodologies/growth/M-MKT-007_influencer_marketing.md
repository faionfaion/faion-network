## Problem

You need to reach new audiences but building your own following takes years. Without influencer partnerships, you miss the fastest way to build credibility and reach through trusted voices.

Most influencer marketing fails because companies pick influencers by follower count alone, don't align on goals, or create campaigns that feel inauthentic.

---

## Framework

Influencer marketing follows the FIND-FIT-FLOW approach:

```
Find → Fit → Flow → Measure
  ↓      ↓     ↓       ↓
Search  Vet  Execute  Analyze
```

### Step 1: Find Influencers

**Influencer tiers:**

| Tier | Followers | Pros | Cons |
|------|-----------|------|------|
| **Nano** | 1K-10K | High engagement, affordable | Limited reach |
| **Micro** | 10K-100K | Trusted, accessible | Some cost |
| **Mid** | 100K-500K | Good reach, manageable | Higher cost |
| **Macro** | 500K-1M | Large reach | Expensive, less engaged |
| **Mega** | 1M+ | Massive reach | Very expensive |

**Best starting point:** Micro-influencers (10K-100K). Best ROI for most brands.

**Finding methods:**

1. **Manual search**
   - Search relevant hashtags
   - Look at who your audience follows
   - Check competitor collaborations

2. **Tools**
   - Modash, HypeAuditor, Upfluence
   - BuzzSumo (content creators)
   - SparkToro (audience research)

3. **Outbound**
   - Search Twitter bios
   - YouTube in your niche
   - Newsletter directories

### Step 2: Vet for Fit

**Evaluation criteria:**

| Criteria | Weight | What to Check |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Audience match** | 30% | Demographics, interests |
| **Engagement rate** | 25% | Likes, comments, shares |
| **Content quality** | 20% | Production, authenticity |
| **Brand safety** | 15% | Controversial content |
| **Professionalism** | 10% | Response time, reliability |

**Engagement rate benchmarks:**

| Platform | Good | Great |
|----------|------|-------|
| Instagram | 2-3% | 4%+ |
| TikTok | 3-5% | 8%+ |
| Twitter | 1-2% | 3%+ |
| YouTube | 2-4% | 5%+ |

**Red flags:**
- Sudden follower spikes (bought followers)
- Low engagement despite high followers
- Generic comments (bots)
- No real conversations with audience
- Too many sponsored posts

### Step 3: Outreach & Negotiation
