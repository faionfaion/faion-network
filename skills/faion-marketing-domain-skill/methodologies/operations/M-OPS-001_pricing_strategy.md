## Problem

You've built something people want, but you don't know what to charge. Price too high and no one buys. Price too low and you leave money on the table—or worse, signal low quality. Your pricing determines your business model, customer expectations, and growth trajectory.

Pricing strategy means finding the price that maximizes revenue while aligning with your value proposition.

---

## Framework

Pricing follows value-based thinking:

```
UNDERSTAND  -> Know your value and costs
RESEARCH    -> Study willingness to pay
STRUCTURE   -> Design your pricing model
TEST        -> Validate with real customers
ITERATE     -> Adjust based on data
```

### Step 1: Understand Your Value

**Calculate your costs (floor):**

| Cost Type | Examples | How to Calculate |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Fixed costs | Hosting, tools, salaries | Monthly total |
| Variable costs | Support time, API calls | Per-customer basis |
| Opportunity cost | Your time | Hourly rate x hours |

**Identify your value (ceiling):**

| Value Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Time saved | Hours saved per month | 10 hrs x $50/hr = $500 |
| Money saved | Cost reduction | Replaces $500/mo tool |
| Money earned | Revenue increase | Generates $2K/mo leads |
| Risk reduced | Problems avoided | Prevents $10K mistakes |

**Value-based pricing rule:**
```
Your price should be 10-20% of the value you deliver.
If you save customers $500/month, charge $50-100/month.
```

### Step 2: Research Willingness to Pay

**Survey approach:**

**Van Westendorp questions:**
1. At what price would this be too expensive? (too expensive)
2. At what price would this be expensive but worth considering? (expensive)
3. At what price would this be a bargain? (cheap)
4. At what price would this be so cheap you'd question quality? (too cheap)

**Analysis:**
- Optimal price: intersection of "too cheap" and "expensive"
- Acceptable range: between "too cheap" and "too expensive"

**Competitor research:**

| Competitor | Price | Features | Positioning |
|------------|-------|----------|-------------|
| [Name] | $X/mo | [List] | Budget |
| [Name] | $X/mo | [List] | Mid-market |
| [Name] | $X/mo | [List] | Premium |

### Step 3: Choose Pricing Model

**Common models:**

| Model | How It Works | Best For |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Flat rate** | One price for everything | Simple products |
| **Tiered** | Good/Better/Best | Feature differentiation |
| **Usage-based** | Pay per unit | Variable value delivery |
| **Per-seat** | Price per user | Team tools |
| **Freemium** | Free tier + paid upgrade | High volume, low touch |
| **Hybrid** | Base + usage | SaaS with variable costs |

**Tier structure (recommended for most):**

| Tier | Target | Features | Price Anchor |
|------|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Free/Basic** | Lead gen | Core features, limits | $0 |
| **Pro** | Main revenue | Full features | Your target price |
| **Enterprise** | Upmarket | Custom, support | 3-5x Pro price |

### Step 4: Set Your Prices

**Psychological pricing:**

| Tactic | Example | Why It Works |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Charm pricing | $49 vs $50 | Left-digit effect |
| Round for premium | $100 vs $99 | Signals quality |
| Anchor high | Show $200, sell $99 | Comparative value |
| Monthly/annual | $19/mo vs $190/yr | Annual = commitment |

**Price points to test:**

| Stage | Monthly | Annual (2 mo free) |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Entry | $9-19 | $90-190 |
| Growth | $29-49 | $290-490 |
| Pro | $79-149 | $790-1490 |
| Business | $199-499 | Custom |

### Step 5: Test and Iterate

**A/B testing prices:**

| Method | How It Works | Considerations |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Geo-based | Different prices by region | Legal in most cases |
| Time-based | Change price, measure | Inconsistent experience |
| Feature-based | Same price, different features | Best approach |

**Signals to raise prices:**
- Conversion rate > 5%
- Low churn
- Customers say "this is cheap"
- No price objections in sales

**Signals to lower prices:**
- Conversion rate < 1%
- High price objections
- Competitors winning on price
- Long sales cycles
