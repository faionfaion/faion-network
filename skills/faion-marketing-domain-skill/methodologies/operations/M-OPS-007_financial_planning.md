## Problem

You're building a business, not a hobby. But you don't know your numbers. You don't know your profit margin, your runway, or whether you can afford to invest in growth. Without financial clarity, you're flying blind.

Financial planning means understanding your money so you can make better decisions.

---

## Framework

Financial planning follows this structure:

```
TRACK    -> Know where money goes
ANALYZE  -> Understand unit economics
FORECAST -> Project the future
DECIDE   -> Make informed choices
REVIEW   -> Adjust based on reality
```

### Step 1: Track Everything

**Essential tracking:**

| Category | What to Track | Tool |
|----------|---------------|------|
| Revenue | All income sources | Stripe, accounting |
| Expenses | All costs | Bank, accounting |
| Cash | Bank balance | Bank |
| Receivables | Money owed to you | Invoicing tool |
| Metrics | MRR, churn, CAC | Spreadsheet |

**Revenue tracking:**

| Revenue Type | How to Track |
|--------------|--------------|
| Subscriptions | Stripe dashboard, MRR |
| One-time sales | Payment processor |
| Services | Invoices sent/paid |
| Affiliate/ads | Platform reporting |

**Expense categories:**

| Category | Examples | Typical % |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Infrastructure | Hosting, tools, domains | 5-15% |
| Marketing | Ads, content, tools | 10-30% |
| Operations | Software, services | 5-10% |
| Contractors | Design, dev, support | 10-30% |
| Administrative | Legal, accounting | 2-5% |
| Owner pay | Your salary | Remainder |

### Step 2: Understand Unit Economics

**Key metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Healthy Target |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **LTV** | ARPU / Churn rate | > 3x CAC |
| **CAC** | Marketing spend / New customers | < 1/3 LTV |
| **Gross margin** | (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | > 70% (SaaS) |
| **Net margin** | Profit / Revenue | > 20% |
| **Payback period** | CAC / (ARPU x Gross margin) | < 12 months |

**Example calculation:**

```
ARPU = $50/month
Churn = 5%/month
LTV = $50 / 0.05 = $1,000

Ad spend = $5,000
New customers = 50
CAC = $5,000 / 50 = $100

LTV:CAC = $1,000 / $100 = 10:1 (excellent)
```

### Step 3: Build Financial Model

**Simple P&L model:**

```markdown
## Monthly P&L

### Revenue
- Subscription: $X
- One-time: $X
- Other: $X
- **Total Revenue: $X**

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
- Hosting: $X
- Transaction fees: $X
- **Total COGS: $X**

### Gross Profit: $X (X%)

### Operating Expenses
- Marketing: $X
- Tools/software: $X
- Contractors: $X
- Other: $X
- **Total OpEx: $X**

### Operating Profit: $X (X%)

### Owner Pay: $X
### Net Profit: $X (X%)
```

**Cash flow projection:**

| Month | Starting | Revenue | Expenses | Ending |
|-------|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Jan | $10K | $5K | $4K | $11K |
| Feb | $11K | $6K | $4K | $13K |
| Mar | $13K | $7K | $5K | $15K |

### Step 4: Plan for Growth

**Reinvestment framework:**

| Profit Level | Reinvestment | Owner Pay | Reserve |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Breakeven | 0% | 0% | 100% |
| < $5K profit | 50% | 30% | 20% |
| $5-15K profit | 40% | 40% | 20% |
| > $15K profit | 30% | 50% | 20% |

**Investment priorities:**

| Priority | Why | Example |
|----------|-----|---------|
| 1. Retention | Keeps revenue | Product improvements |
| 2. Conversion | More customers | Landing page optimization |
| 3. Acquisition | Growth | Ads, content |
| 4. Operations | Efficiency | Tools, automation |
| 5. Expansion | New revenue | New features, products |

### Step 5: Financial Safety

**Runway calculation:**

```
Runway = Cash on hand / Monthly burn rate

$30,000 cash / $5,000 monthly expenses = 6 months runway
```

**Safety targets:**

| Stage | Minimum Runway |
|-------|----------------|
| Pre-revenue | 12+ months |
| Early revenue | 6+ months |
| Growing | 3+ months |
| Profitable | 3+ months (emergency fund) |

**Emergency fund:**

```
Target: 3 months of operating expenses
If expenses = $5K/month
Emergency fund = $15K (separate account)
```
