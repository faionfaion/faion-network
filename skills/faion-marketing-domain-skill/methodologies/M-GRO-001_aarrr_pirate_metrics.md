## Problem

You need a framework to measure and optimize the entire customer journey. Without it, you focus on vanity metrics like page views instead of metrics that drive revenue.

Most startups track everything or nothing. Both approaches fail. You need 5 key metrics that tell the complete story of your growth.

---

## Framework

AARRR (also called "Pirate Metrics") breaks the customer journey into 5 stages:

```
Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue → Referral
     ↓            ↓            ↓          ↓          ↓
 How users     First       Coming     Making    Spreading
 find you      value       back       money     the word
```

### Stage 1: Acquisition

**Question:** How do users find you?

**Metrics:**
- Website visitors (by channel)
- App downloads
- Sign-ups
- Cost per acquisition (CPA)

**Channels to track:**
- Organic search (SEO)
- Paid ads (Google, Meta, LinkedIn)
- Social media
- Referrals
- Direct traffic
- Email

**Formula:**
```
CPA = Total Marketing Spend / Number of New Users
```

### Stage 2: Activation

**Question:** Do users have a great first experience?

**Metrics:**
- Sign-up completion rate
- Onboarding completion rate
- Time to first value (TTFV)
- Activation rate

**Formula:**
```
Activation Rate = Users Who Completed Key Action / Total Sign-ups x 100%
```

**Key action examples:**
- Completed profile
- Made first post
- Sent first message
- Created first project

### Stage 3: Retention

**Question:** Do users come back?

**Metrics:**
- Day 1, Day 7, Day 30 retention
- Weekly active users (WAU)
- Monthly active users (MAU)
- Churn rate

**Formula:**
```
D7 Retention = Users Active on Day 7 / Users Who Signed Up 7 Days Ago x 100%

Churn Rate = Users Lost This Period / Users at Start of Period x 100%
```

**Benchmarks (SaaS):**
- Good D1 retention: 40-60%
- Good D7 retention: 20-30%
- Good D30 retention: 10-15%

### Stage 4: Revenue

**Question:** How do you make money?

**Metrics:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Conversion rate (free to paid)

**Formulas:**
```
MRR = Number of Paying Customers x Average Monthly Price

ARPU = Total Revenue / Number of Users

LTV = ARPU x Average Customer Lifespan (months)
```

### Stage 5: Referral

**Question:** Do users tell others?

**Metrics:**
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)
- Referral rate
- Viral coefficient (K-factor)
- Referral revenue

**Formula:**
```
K-factor = Invites Sent x Conversion Rate of Invites

Referral Rate = Users Who Referred / Total Users x 100%
```

| Wrong activation metric | False signal of user value | Track action tied to retention |
| Ignoring referral | Missing free growth | Add referral program early |
| Not segmenting | Averages hide problems | Segment by cohort, channel, plan |
