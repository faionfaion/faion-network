## Problem

Traditional SaaS sales require expensive sales teams, long cycles, and high customer acquisition costs. You cannot scale revenue without scaling headcount.

Product-Led Growth (PLG) makes the product itself the main driver of acquisition, conversion, and expansion. Users can discover, try, buy, and upgrade without talking to sales.

---

## Framework

### What is Product-Led Growth?

PLG is a go-to-market strategy where the product is the primary vehicle for acquiring, activating, and retaining customers.

```
TRADITIONAL (SALES-LED)              PRODUCT-LED (PLG)
──────────────────────────           ──────────────────────
Marketing → MQL → Sales →            Marketing → Product →
Demo → Negotiate → Close             Self-serve → Activate →
Onboard → Support                    Expand → Upgrade

High touch, expensive                Low touch, scalable
$50K+ deals                          $0 to $XX,XXX deals
Long cycles (weeks/months)           Fast cycles (minutes/days)
```

### PLG vs Sales-Led vs Marketing-Led

| Aspect | Sales-Led | Marketing-Led | Product-Led |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Primary driver | Sales team | Content/ads | Product experience |
| First touch | Demo request | Content download | Free trial/freemium |
| Conversion | Sales negotiation | Marketing nurture | Self-serve upgrade |
| CAC | High ($500-5,000+) | Medium ($100-500) | Low ($10-100) |
| Deal size | Large ($10K+/yr) | Medium ($1K-10K) | Any size |
| Scale | Linear (add reps) | Semi-scalable | Exponential |

## Implementing PLG

### Step 1: Define Your Aha Moment

The "Aha moment" is when users first experience core value.

**Examples:**

| Product | Aha Moment |
|---------|------------|
| Slack | First message in channel |
| Dropbox | First file synced across devices |
| Zoom | First successful video call |
| Notion | First page created and shared |
| Figma | First design collaboration |

**How to find your Aha moment:**

1. Interview converted users: "When did you decide to pay?"
2. Analyze behavior of retained vs churned users
3. Find the action most correlated with retention
4. Validate with cohort analysis

### Step 2: Optimize Time to Value (TTV)

TTV = Time from signup to Aha moment

```
BAD TTV (days/weeks)              GOOD TTV (minutes)
─────────────────────────         ─────────────────────
Long onboarding                   Skip onboarding
Setup required                    Pre-configured
Learning curve                    Intuitive UI
Empty state                       Sample data/templates
```

**TTV Reduction Tactics:**

| Tactic | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Progressive onboarding | Learn while doing | High |
| Templates | Start with examples | High |
| Pre-filled data | Show populated state | Medium |
| Interactive tutorials | Guided first use | High |
| Single-player mode | Work alone first | Medium |
| Social login | Reduce signup friction | Medium |

### Step 3: Build In-Product Upgrade Triggers

**Types of upgrade triggers:**

| Trigger | Example | When to Show |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Usage limit | "You've used 80% of storage" | Near limit |
| Feature gate | "Upgrade to export as PDF" | Feature use |
| Time limit | "Trial ends in 3 days" | Trial ending |
| Collaboration | "Invite team members" | Ready to expand |
| Value milestone | "You've saved 10 hours" | Value proven |

**In-product upgrade UI:**

```
Bad:  Intrusive pop-up on every page
Good: Contextual prompt when user hits limit

Bad:  "Upgrade to Pro for $99/mo"
Good: "You're trying to invite a 4th member.
       Upgrade to Team plan to add unlimited members."
```

### Step 4: Enable Self-Serve Purchasing

**Self-serve checkout essentials:**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Clear pricing | No "contact sales" for basic plans |
| Plan comparison | Feature matrix |
| Instant access | No approval wait |
| Multiple payment | Card, PayPal, invoicing |
| Proration | Upgrade mid-cycle |
| Easy downgrade | Reduce friction to try higher tier |

### Step 5: Implement Product-Qualified Leads (PQLs)

PQLs replace MQLs in PLG. They are users who show buying intent through product behavior.

**PQL signals:**

| Signal | Weight | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Heavy usage | High | 100+ actions/week |
| Team growth | High | Invited 5+ members |
| Premium feature attempt | High | Tried gated feature |
| Time in product | Medium | 10+ hours/month |
| Integration usage | Medium | Connected 3+ tools |
| Export/share | Medium | Downloaded reports |

**PQL scoring model:**

```
PQL Score = Sum of (Signal × Weight)

Thresholds:
- Score < 50: Nurture with product
- Score 50-80: Automated upgrade prompts
- Score > 80: Sales outreach (if enterprise)
```
