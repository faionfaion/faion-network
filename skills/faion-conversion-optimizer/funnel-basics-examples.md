## Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Signup Funnel

**Problem:** Low overall conversion (2%)

**Funnel:**
```
Homepage    → 10,000 (100%)
Pricing     →  2,000 (20%)   ← 80% drop
Signup      →    800 (8%)    ← 60% drop
Trial       →    400 (4%)    ← 50% drop
Paid        →    200 (2%)    ← 50% drop
```

**Diagnosis:**
1. Homepage → Pricing (80% drop): Value prop unclear
2. Pricing → Signup (60% drop): Pricing confusing

**Tests run:**

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Clearer headline on homepage | +15% to pricing page |
| Simplified pricing (3 → 2 tiers) | +25% signup rate |
| Added "Start free" emphasis | +10% trial start |

**Result:**
```
Before: 2.0% overall conversion
After:  3.8% overall conversion (+90% improvement)
```

### Example 2: E-commerce Checkout

**Funnel:**
```
Product Page → 50,000 (100%)
Add to Cart  → 10,000 (20%)
Checkout     →  4,000 (8%)   ← 60% abandon cart
Payment      →  2,500 (5%)
Confirm      →  2,000 (4%)
```

**Cart abandonment analysis:**
- 35% left at shipping costs reveal
- 25% left at account creation requirement
- 20% left at payment form
- 20% other

**Optimizations:**
1. Show shipping costs on product page → -15% abandonment
2. Add guest checkout → -20% abandonment
3. Express checkout (Apple Pay, Google Pay) → +12% completion

### Example 3: Mobile App Onboarding

**Funnel:**
```
Install     → 10,000 (100%)
Open app    →  7,500 (75%)   ← 25% never open
Screen 1    →  6,000 (60%)   ← 20% drop
Screen 2    →  4,500 (45%)   ← 25% drop
Screen 3    →  3,000 (30%)   ← 33% drop
Core action →  1,500 (15%)   ← 50% drop
```

**Diagnosis:**
- Onboarding too long (3 screens)
- Users not reaching core value

**Solution:**
- Reduce to 1 welcome screen
- Skip to core action immediately
- Show onboarding tips contextually

**Result:**
```
Before: 15% reach core action
After:  42% reach core action (+180%)
```

### Example 4: B2B Lead Generation

**Funnel:**
```
Blog Post     → 100,000 (100%)
Download CTA  →  10,000 (10%)
Lead Form     →   5,000 (5%)   ← 50% drop
Form Submit   →   3,500 (3.5%) ← 30% drop
Email Open    →   1,750 (1.75%)
Demo Request  →     350 (0.35%)
```

**Optimization:**
1. Changed CTA from "Download whitepaper" to "Get free checklist" → +25% clicks
2. Reduced form fields from 8 to 3 → +40% completion
3. A/B tested email subject lines → +15% open rate
4. Added demo video in email → +20% demo requests

**Result:**
```
Before: 0.35% blog → demo conversion
After:  0.98% blog → demo conversion (+180%)
```

### Example 5: Subscription Service

**Funnel:**
```
Landing Page   → 20,000 (100%)
Start Trial    →  4,000 (20%)
Day 3 Active   →  2,800 (14%)  ← 30% drop
Day 7 Active   →  2,000 (10%)  ← 28% drop
Subscription   →  1,000 (5%)   ← 50% drop
```

**Analysis:**
- Users not experiencing value in first 3 days
- No reminder emails during trial
- Payment friction at conversion

**Improvements:**
1. Send onboarding email sequence (Days 1, 3, 5, 7) → +20% Day 7 active
2. Add "time-to-value" checklist in app → +15% activation
3. Pre-authorize payment card → +25% conversion
