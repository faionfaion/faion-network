# Checklist: Funnel Optimization Framework

## Phase 1: Map the Funnel

- [ ] Define all steps from entry to goal
- [ ] Identify main funnel type (marketing, SaaS, e-commerce, mobile)
- [ ] Document step sequence visually
- [ ] Name each step clearly (event names match analytics)
- [ ] Identify entry point (where users come from)
- [ ] Identify conversion goal (what success looks like)
- [ ] Document any alternate paths or segments
- [ ] Get stakeholder agreement on funnel definition

## Phase 2: Measure Each Step

- [ ] Set up event tracking for all steps
- [ ] Track users at each step for minimum 7 days
- [ ] Calculate conversion rate: (users at step N / users at step 1) × 100
- [ ] Calculate drop rate: ((users at N - users at N+1) / users at N) × 100
- [ ] Collect at least 30 days of historical data
- [ ] Segment by: traffic source, device, new vs. returning
- [ ] Document metrics in spreadsheet or analytics tool
- [ ] Ensure data quality (no tracking errors, complete data)

## Phase 3: Find the Biggest Drop

- [ ] Rank each step transition by users lost
- [ ] Calculate % of total drop at each step
- [ ] Identify top 3 steps with biggest drop-offs
- [ ] Consider both absolute drop and percentage
- [ ] Check which drop has biggest financial impact
- [ ] Visualize funnel with bar chart or waterfall
- [ ] Present findings to team

## Phase 4: Diagnose the Cause

- [ ] Review session recordings for that step
- [ ] Check heatmaps (where do users click/scroll?)
- [ ] Run user survey at drop-off point (exit intent)
- [ ] Conduct 5-10 user interviews (for major products)
- [ ] Check for technical errors in logs
- [ ] Compare mobile vs. desktop behavior
- [ ] Test page load speed at that step
- [ ] Document all findings and root causes

## Phase 5: Generate Hypotheses

- [ ] Create 5-10 hypothesis statements using template
- [ ] Base each hypothesis on diagnosis findings
- [ ] Ensure each hypothesis is testable
- [ ] Consider both design, copy, and flow changes
- [ ] Rate feasibility (quick wins first)
- [ ] Document reasoning for each hypothesis
- [ ] Prioritize using ICE framework

## Phase 6: Test and Iterate

- [ ] Rank hypotheses by ICE score
- [ ] Set up A/B test for top hypothesis
- [ ] Define control and variant clearly
- [ ] Set duration until statistical significance
- [ ] Track primary metric + secondary metrics
- [ ] Monitor test for anomalies
- [ ] Analyze results when test concludes
- [ ] Document winner and loser

## Phase 7: Repeat & Optimize

- [ ] Implement winning test if lift > threshold
- [ ] Document learnings and surprising findings
- [ ] Move to next hypothesis or next biggest drop
- [ ] Set up ongoing weekly/monthly funnel reviews
- [ ] Track cumulative improvements over time
- [ ] Share results with team and stakeholders
