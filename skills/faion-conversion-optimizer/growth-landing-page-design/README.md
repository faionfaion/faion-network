## Problem

Your ads drive traffic, but visitors leave without converting. Without a well-designed landing page, you waste ad spend and lose potential customers at the final step.

Most landing pages fail because they try to do too much. They confuse visitors with multiple CTAs, unclear value propositions, and walls of text.

---

## Framework

A high-converting landing page follows the AIDA structure:

```
Attention  → Hero section captures interest in 5 seconds
Interest   → Benefits explain why they should care
Desire     → Social proof builds trust and want
Action     → CTA tells them exactly what to do
```

### Section 1: Hero (Above the Fold)

**Must include:**
- **Headline:** Clear benefit, not feature (6-12 words)
- **Subheadline:** Expand on headline, add specificity
- **Visual:** Product screenshot, illustration, or video
- **CTA:** One clear action
- **Social proof snippet:** "Trusted by 10,000+ users"

**Formula for headlines:**

```
[Outcome] + [Timeframe] + [Without Pain Point]

Examples:
- "Build your SaaS in 2 weeks without writing backend code"
- "Get 10K followers in 90 days without posting daily"
- "Learn Spanish in 3 months without boring textbooks"
```

### Section 2: Problem Agitation

**Structure:**
1. State the problem they have
2. Agitate: show consequences
3. Hint at solution

```markdown
## You're losing customers every day

Your checkout has 3 pages. 67% of carts get abandoned.
That's $X,000 in lost revenue every month.

There's a better way.
```

### Section 3: Solution / Benefits

**Show benefits, not features:**

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| AI-powered | Get answers in seconds, not hours |
| 99.9% uptime | Never lose a sale to downtime |
| 50+ integrations | Works with tools you already use |

**Use the "So what?" test:** After each feature, ask "So what?" The answer is the benefit.

### Section 4: How It Works

**3-step process works best:**

```
Step 1: Connect your data (2 minutes)
Step 2: AI analyzes patterns (automatic)
Step 3: Get actionable insights (instant)
```

Keep it simple. If your product is complex, simplify it anyway.

### Section 5: Social Proof

**Types of social proof (in order of effectiveness):**

1. **Customer logos** (B2B)
2. **Testimonials with photos** (specific results)
3. **Case studies** (detailed stories)
4. **Numbers** ("50,000+ users")
5. **Press mentions** ("Featured in TechCrunch")
6. **Ratings** ("4.9 stars on G2")

**Testimonial formula:**

```markdown
"[Specific result achieved] in [timeframe]. Before [product],
I struggled with [problem]. Now [positive outcome]."

— [Name], [Title] at [Company]
```

### Section 6: Pricing (Optional)

If showing pricing on landing page:
- **3 tiers maximum**
- **Highlight recommended tier**
- **Annual savings badge**
- **Money-back guarantee**

### Section 7: FAQ

Address objections:
- "Is my data secure?"
- "Can I cancel anytime?"
- "Do you offer refunds?"
- "How is this different from [competitor]?"

### Section 8: Final CTA

Repeat your main CTA with:
- Benefit reminder
- Urgency (if appropriate)
- Risk reversal ("30-day money-back guarantee")
