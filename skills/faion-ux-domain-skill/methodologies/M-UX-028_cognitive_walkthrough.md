## Problem

New users struggle with your product but you don't understand why. User testing is not available for early designs. The team thinks the interface is intuitive but users disagree. Onboarding is complex but you can't pinpoint problems. You need to evaluate learnability specifically.

Without cognitive walkthrough:
- Learnability issues hidden
- First-time user struggles missed
- Onboarding problems unclear
- Unintuitive flows remain

---

## Framework

### What is Cognitive Walkthrough?

A cognitive walkthrough is a usability inspection method where evaluators step through a task from the user's perspective, focusing on whether a first-time user can figure out how to complete the task without prior training.

### Focus Areas

| Area | Questions |
|------|-----------|
| **Learnability** | Can new users figure it out? |
| **Action visibility** | Is the next step obvious? |
| **Understanding** | Will users know what to do? |
| **Feedback** | Will users know they did right? |

### Cognitive Walkthrough vs. Heuristic Evaluation

| Aspect | Cognitive Walkthrough | Heuristic Evaluation |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Focus | Task completion by new user | Broad usability principles |
| Method | Step-by-step task analysis | Expert review against heuristics |
| Questions | 4 specific questions per step | 10 general heuristics |
| Best for | Learnability, onboarding | General usability issues |

## Process

### Step 1: Define Prerequisites

**Identify:**
- Target user persona
- Task to evaluate
- Correct action sequence
- Interface to evaluate (prototype or live)

```
Example:
Persona: First-time user, no prior experience
Task: Create a new account and set up profile
Correct sequence:
1. Click "Sign Up"
2. Enter email
3. Enter password
4. Click "Create Account"
5. Enter profile name
6. Upload photo (optional)
7. Click "Complete Setup"
```

### Step 2: Assemble Evaluators

**Who should participate:**
- UX designers
- Product managers
- Developers
- Anyone who understands users

**Group size:** 2-4 evaluators

### Step 3: Walk Through Each Step

For each action in the sequence, ask:

**Question 1: Will the user try to achieve the right effect?**
- Does the user know they need to do something?
- Does the user understand the goal?

**Question 2: Will the user notice that the correct action is available?**
- Is the action visible?
- Is it in an expected location?

**Question 3: Will the user associate the correct action with the desired effect?**
- Does the label make sense?
- Is the purpose clear?

**Question 4: If the correct action is performed, will the user see that progress is being made?**
- Is there feedback?
- Does the user know it worked?

### Step 4: Document Issues

For any "No" answer:
- Describe the problem
- Explain why it's an issue
- Suggest a solution

### Step 5: Summarize Findings

- List all issues found
- Prioritize by severity
- Recommend fixes

## Examples

### Example 1: Sign-Up Flow

**Step:** Click "Get Started" button

| Question | Answer | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Q1: Will try? | Yes | Clear value proposition above button |
| Q2: Will notice? | Partial | Button visible but competes with "Sign In" |
| Q3: Will associate? | No | "Get Started" unclear if it means sign up or demo |
| Q4: Progress visible? | Yes | Takes user to registration form |

**Issue:** "Get Started" is ambiguous
**Fix:** Change to "Create Free Account"

### Example 2: File Upload

**Step:** Drag file to upload zone

| Question | Answer | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Q1: Will try? | Partial | Users might look for browse button first |
| Q2: Will notice? | Yes | Large drop zone visible |
| Q3: Will associate? | Yes | Icon and text suggest drag-drop |
| Q4: Progress visible? | No | No indication file is uploading |

**Issue:** Missing upload progress indicator
**Fix:** Add progress bar and file name during upload

## The Four Questions Deep Dive

### Q1: Will user try to achieve right effect?

**Checks:**
- Is the goal clear?
- Does user know action is needed?
- Is motivation present?

**Common failures:**
- User doesn't know something is required
- User thinks they're done when they're not
- Goal is unclear

### Q2: Will user notice correct action available?

**Checks:**
- Is control visible?
- Is it in expected location?
- Does it stand out?

**Common failures:**
- Action is below the fold
- Control doesn't look clickable
- Too many competing options

### Q3: Will user associate action with effect?

**Checks:**
- Is the label clear?
- Is the icon recognizable?
- Does it match user's mental model?

**Common failures:**
- Jargon in labels
- Ambiguous icons
- Unexpected location

### Q4: Will user see progress is being made?

**Checks:**
- Is there feedback?
- Does UI change appropriately?
- Is success communicated?

**Common failures:**
- No loading indicator
- Page looks the same after action
- Error not displayed

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using power users** - Should evaluate for first-time users
2. **Skipping steps** - Must evaluate every action
3. **Not documenting "Yes"** - Record positive findings too
4. **Vague issues** - Be specific about what's wrong
5. **No recommendations** - Always suggest a fix

---

## Best Practices

### Before the Walkthrough

```
Preparation:
- Have working interface ready
- Print evaluation forms
- Define realistic user persona
- Identify complete action sequence

- Take notes on the spot
- Capture screenshots
- Discuss disagreements
```

### After the Walkthrough

```
Follow-up:
- Compile findings immediately
- Prioritize issues
- Share with team
- Track fixes
- Consider re-evaluation
```
