## Problem

Users must remember information from one part of the interface to use in another. They need to recall command syntax or codes. Options are hidden until users know to look for them. Instructions disappear before users can follow them. Memory becomes a barrier to use.

Without recognition support:
- Cognitive overload
- Slower task completion
- More errors
- Frustration

---

## The Heuristic

**Nielsen Norman Heuristic #6:** Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design should be visible or easily retrievable.

## Framework

### Recognition vs. Recall

| Recognition | Recall |
|-------------|--------|
| See and choose | Remember and type |
| Menu selection | Command line |
| Autocomplete | Blank field |
| Visual cues | Hidden options |
| Lower cognitive load | Higher cognitive load |

### Design Principles

1. **Make options visible** - Show rather than hide
2. **Provide context** - Keep relevant info visible
3. **Use recognition aids** - Icons, labels, thumbnails
4. **Support retrieval** - Recent items, search, suggestions

---

## Implementation Patterns

### Visible Options

**Navigation:**
```
Bad: Hidden hamburger menu (must remember what is inside)
Good: Visible tabs for main sections
```

**Actions:**
```
Bad: Right-click for all actions
Good: Visible toolbar with common actions
```

### Contextual Information

**Forms with reference:**
```
Editing order: Show order details in sidebar
User cannot forget what they are editing
```

**Multi-step processes:**
```
Show summary of previous selections
User does not need to remember earlier choices
```

### Recognition Aids

**File browser:**
```
Bad: List of filenames only
Good: Thumbnails for images, previews for documents
```

**Recent items:**
```
Show recently used items prominently
User recognizes rather than recalls
```

**Search with suggestions:**
```
Bad: Empty search box
Good: Search with autocomplete, recent searches, suggestions
```

### Labels and Icons

**Icon + label:**
```
Bad: Icon only (user must remember meaning)
Good: Icon + text label
```

**Tooltips:**
```
For space-constrained areas
Icon + tooltip on hover
```

## Templates

### Recognition Audit

```markdown
# Recognition Audit: [Feature]

**Date:** [Date]
**Reviewer:** [Name]

## Recall Requirements

| Task | Recall Required | Recognition Alternative |
|------|-----------------|------------------------|
| [Task] | [What user must remember] | [How to show instead] |

## Hidden Information

| Information | Where Hidden | Should Be Visible? |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| [Info] | [Location] | Y/N |

## Icons Without Labels

| Icon | Meaning | Label Needed? |
|------|---------|---------------|
| [Icon] | [Meaning] | Y/N |

## Recommendations

| Issue | Impact | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| [Issue] | H/M/L | [Fix] |
```

## Examples

### Good Examples

**Google Search:**
- Recent searches shown
- Autocomplete suggestions
- "Did you mean" corrections
- Related searches

**Spotify:**
- Album art thumbnails
- Recently played prominent
- Search suggestions
- Visual playlists

**VS Code:**
- Command palette (Ctrl+P)
- Recent files shown
- Fuzzy search for commands
- Icons + labels in menus

### Bad Examples

**Codes required:**
```
"Enter product code: ___"
User must remember arbitrary codes
Better: Product picker with images and names
```

**Hidden features:**
```
"To export, use Ctrl+Shift+E"
User must remember shortcut
Better: Export button visible + shortcut as hint
```

**No context:**
```
Page 3 of checkout
Previous selections not visible
User cannot remember address entered on Page 1
Better: Show summary panel of all selections
```

## Techniques for Reducing Memory Load

### Progressive Disclosure

```
Show essential options always
Reveal advanced options on demand
User does not need to remember what is available
```

### Smart Defaults

```
Pre-fill with likely values
User recognizes and confirms rather than recalls and enters
```

### Search and Filter

```
Instead of browsing hundreds of options
Let user search and see results
Recognition of results easier than recall of location
```

### History and Recent

```
Recent documents
Recent searches
Frequently used items
Favorites
```

### Consistent Placement

```
Keep elements in same location
User recognizes location, does not recall where to look
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Icon-only toolbars** - Users must memorize icons
2. **Deep menus** - Users must recall menu structure
3. **No recent items** - Users start from scratch
4. **Hidden shortcuts** - Only power users know them
5. **Disappearing instructions** - Gone before user can follow

---

## Accessibility Connection

Recognition-based design helps:
- Users with cognitive disabilities
- Older users
- Occasional users
- Users in stressful situations
- Users on mobile (divided attention)

---

## Measuring Recognition Support

| Metric | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| Task completion time | Faster with recognition aids |
| Error rate | Fewer recall errors |
| Help requests | Less "where is X?" |
| User confidence | Self-reported ease |
| Learnability | Time to proficiency |
