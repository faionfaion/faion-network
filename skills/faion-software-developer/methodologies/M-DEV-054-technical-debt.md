# M-DEV-054: Technical Debt

## Overview

Technical debt represents the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy or quick solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer. Managing technical debt involves identifying, tracking, and strategically paying it down.

## When to Use

- Planning sprint capacity for maintenance
- Evaluating trade-offs during implementation
- Prioritizing refactoring work
- Communicating costs to stakeholders
- Making architectural decisions

## Key Principles

- **Debt is not always bad**: Strategic debt can accelerate delivery
- **Track explicitly**: Make debt visible and measurable
- **Pay interest regularly**: Budget time for debt reduction
- **Prioritize by impact**: Fix high-impact debt first
- **Prevent accumulation**: Code reviews, standards, automation

## Best Practices

### Types of Technical Debt

## Common Types
1. Code Debt: Messy code, duplication, poor naming
2. Design Debt: Poor architecture, tight coupling
3. Test Debt: Missing tests, flaky tests
4. Documentation Debt: Outdated or missing docs
5. Infrastructure Debt: Outdated dependencies, legacy systems
6. Process Debt: Missing CI/CD, manual deployments
```

### Measuring Technical Debt

```python
# Metrics for tracking debt

"""
## Technical Debt Metrics

### Code Quality Metrics
- Cyclomatic complexity (target: < 10 per function)
- Code duplication % (target: < 5%)
- Test coverage % (target: > 80%)
- Linting violations (target: 0 blocking)

### Velocity Metrics
- Time to implement features (trending up = debt)
- Bug fix time (trending up = debt)
- Deployment frequency (trending down = debt)
- Lead time for changes (trending up = debt)

### Operational Metrics
- Production incidents/month
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Deployment failure rate
- Rollback frequency

### Tracking Over Time
- Tech debt items created vs resolved
- Debt severity distribution
- Time spent on debt vs features

### Prioritizing Debt Payoff

```markdown
## Debt Prioritization Matrix

### Factors to Consider
1. **Impact on Velocity**: How much does it slow development?
2. **Risk**: What's the probability and impact of failure?
3. **Interest Rate**: How much ongoing cost does it incur?
4. **Fix Cost**: How long to pay off?
5. **Dependencies**: Does other work depend on this fix?

### Priority Calculation
Priority Score = (Impact × Risk × Interest) / Fix Cost

### Example Scoring

| Item | Impact | Risk | Interest | Cost | Score | Priority |
|------|--------|------|----------|------|-------|----------|
| TD-001 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 60h | 1.33 | Medium |
| TD-002 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 40h | 3.13 | High |
| TD-003 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 24h | 1.13 | Medium |
| TD-004 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 80h | 0.05 | Low |

### When to Pay Off Debt

**Pay Now (High Priority)**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data integrity risks
- Blocking other development
- High ongoing maintenance cost

**Pay Soon (Medium Priority)**
- Slowing feature development
- Causing frequent bugs
- Complexity spreading

**Pay Later (Low Priority)**
- Cosmetic issues
- Low-traffic areas
- Stable legacy code
```

### Strategies for Paying Down Debt

```python
# Strategy 1: Boy Scout Rule - Leave code better than you found it

# Before (encountered during feature work)
def process_data(d):
    r = []
    for x in d:
        if x > 0:
            r.append(x * 2)
    return r

# After (small improvement while working on related code)
def process_data(data: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """Double positive numbers in the input list."""
    return [x * 2 for x in data if x > 0]


# Strategy 2: Dedicated Debt Sprints

"""
## Sprint Allocation Strategies

### Continuous (Recommended)
- 20% of each sprint for debt
- Every sprint has some debt work
- Debt never builds up too much

### Periodic
- Every 4th sprint is "tech debt sprint"
- Good for larger refactoring
- Risk: debt builds between sprints

### Triggered
- Debt sprint when threshold exceeded
- Reactive rather than proactive
- Can lead to crisis mode

### Hybrid
- 15% continuous + quarterly debt sprint
- Best of both approaches
- Handles both small and large debt
"""


# Strategy 3: Feature-Attached Debt Payoff

"""
## Attach Debt to Features

When planning a feature that touches debt-ridden code:

1. Identify debt in affected area
2. Include debt payoff in feature estimate
3. Pay debt as part of feature work
4. Prevents adding debt on top of debt

Example:
- Feature: Add subscription tiers
- Affected code: User billing module (has TD-003)
- Approach: Fix TD-003 first, then build feature
- Benefit: Clean foundation for new feature

## Anti-patterns

- **Ignoring debt**: Pretending it doesn't exist
- **Gold plating**: Over-engineering to avoid all debt
- **Debt denial**: "It's not debt, it's just how we do things"
- **Big bang payoff**: Trying to fix everything at once
- **No tracking**: Debt invisible to stakeholders
- **Blame culture**: Punishing debt creation vs. managing it
