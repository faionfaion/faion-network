# Checklist

## Planning Phase

- [ ] Set minimum coverage threshold (typically 80%)
- [ ] Identify critical paths requiring high coverage (90%+)
- [ ] Define coverage metrics (line, branch, path coverage)
- [ ] Plan per-directory thresholds if applicable
- [ ] Identify exclusions (autogenerated code, abstracts)
- [ ] Plan coverage reporting strategy

## Setup Phase

- [ ] Install coverage tools (pytest-cov for Python, Jest for JS)
- [ ] Configure coverage in pyproject.toml or jest.config.js
- [ ] Set up HTML report generation
- [ ] Create exclude patterns for migrations, __pycache__, etc.
- [ ] Configure CI/CD to fail on coverage drops
- [ ] Set up coverage badge for README

## Test Development Phase

- [ ] Write tests for all business logic paths
- [ ] Test happy path for each function
- [ ] Test error/exception paths
- [ ] Test edge cases (None, empty, negative values)
- [ ] Test boundary conditions
- [ ] Test all conditional branches
- [ ] Test with realistic data

## Coverage Analysis Phase

- [ ] Run coverage report and identify gaps
- [ ] Analyze missing lines (are they important?)
- [ ] Identify unreachable code for removal
- [ ] Check branch coverage specifically
- [ ] Review untested error handling
- [ ] Check coverage of integration points

## Verification Phase

- [ ] Verify coverage meets minimum thresholds
- [ ] Verify tests actually test behavior (not just lines)
- [ ] Test that removing code causes test failures
- [ ] Check coverage doesn't include trivial code (getters, properties)
- [ ] Verify new code is tested before merge
- [ ] Monitor coverage trends over time

## CI/CD Integration Phase

- [ ] Configure CI to run with coverage flags
- [ ] Set up coverage reports in PR comments
- [ ] Configure coverage badge
- [ ] Set up alerts for coverage drops
- [ ] Create dashboard for coverage metrics

## Deployment

- [ ] Document coverage standards for team
- [ ] Set up code review checklist requiring tests
- [ ] Create runbook for improving coverage
- [ ] Monitor coverage metrics in production
