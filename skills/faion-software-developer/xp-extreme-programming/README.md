# Extreme Programming (XP)

## Overview

Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development methodology that emphasizes technical excellence and customer satisfaction. XP takes proven development practices to "extreme" levels: if code reviews are good, review all code (pair programming); if testing is good, test everything constantly (TDD); if design is good, make it part of everybody's daily activity (refactoring).

## When to Use

- Projects with rapidly changing requirements
- Small to medium-sized teams (2-12 developers)
- When customer is available for continuous feedback
- Projects requiring high code quality
- When team is co-located or has strong communication

## Key Principles

### Values (5)

1. **Communication**: Face-to-face, frequent, whole team
2. **Simplicity**: Do what is needed, no more
3. **Feedback**: Unit tests, customer acceptance, team retrospectives
4. **Courage**: Refactor, throw away code, speak truth
5. **Respect**: Every team member is valuable

### Practices (12)

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Planning Game** | Customer prioritizes stories, team estimates |
| **Small Releases** | Frequent production releases |
| **Metaphor** | Shared vocabulary for the system |
| **Simple Design** | No unused flexibility, passes all tests |
| **TDD** | Tests written before code |
| **Refactoring** | Continuous design improvement |
| **Pair Programming** | Two developers, one computer |
| **Collective Ownership** | Anyone can change any code |
| **Continuous Integration** | Integrate and test multiple times daily |
| **Sustainable Pace** | 40-hour weeks, no burnout |
| **On-site Customer** | Real customer available for questions |
| **Coding Standards** | Consistent code style across team |

## Best Practices

### Planning Game

```markdown
## User Story Format
As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]

## Story Point Estimation
- 1 point = 1 ideal day
- Use Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
- Stories > 13 points → split

## Iteration Planning
1. Customer presents stories (prioritized)
2. Team estimates each story
3. Team commits to iteration (1-2 weeks)
4. Daily stand-ups track progress
```

### Small Releases

```markdown
## Release Cadence
- Internal: Every iteration (1-2 weeks)
- External: Monthly or more frequently

## Release Criteria
- All tests pass
- Customer acceptance tests pass
- No known critical bugs
- Documentation updated

## Benefits
- Early value delivery
- Fast feedback loop
- Reduced risk
- Customer trust
```

### Simple Design Rules (Priority Order)

```markdown
1. Passes all tests
2. Reveals intention (readable)
3. No duplication (DRY)
4. Fewest elements (classes, methods)

## YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Don't add functionality until needed
- Don't design for future requirements
- Refactor when requirements appear
```

### Collective Code Ownership

```python
# Any developer can modify any code
# Benefits:
# - No bottlenecks (key person dependency)
# - Knowledge sharing
# - Better code quality (many eyes)

# Requirements for success:
# - Strong coding standards
# - Comprehensive tests
# - Pair programming
# - Code reviews (if not pairing)

# Example: Coding standards document
"""
Module docstrings: Required
Function docstrings: Required for public functions
Type hints: Required
Max line length: 88 characters
Imports: isort with black profile
Formatting: black
"""
```

### Continuous Integration (XP Style)

```bash
# XP CI Rules:
# 1. Commit at least once per day
# 2. All tests must pass before commit
# 3. Never leave build broken
# 4. Fix failures immediately

# Integration Flow
git pull origin main
# Run all tests locally
pytest --tb=short
# If pass, commit and push
git add . && git commit -m "feat: add user validation"
git push origin main
# CI runs full test suite
# If fail, fix immediately (drop everything)
```

### Sustainable Pace

```markdown
## 40-Hour Week Rule
- No overtime except emergencies
- Tired developers make mistakes
- Sustainable speed > burst speed

## Signs of Unsustainable Pace
- Increasing bug rate
- Decreasing velocity
- Team conflicts
- Missed stand-ups
- Skipping tests

## Recovery Strategies
- Reduce scope (not quality)
- Add resources (carefully)
- Extend deadline
- Cut features
```

## XP in Modern Context

### XP + Remote Teams

```markdown
## Adaptations
- Pair programming via screen sharing (VS Code Live Share, Tuple)
- Async stand-ups (Slack/Teams)
- Virtual whiteboards for planning (Miro, FigJam)
- More documentation (async communication)

## Tools
- Video: Zoom, Google Meet
- Pairing: Tuple, VS Code Live Share, Pop
- Chat: Slack, Discord
- Planning: Linear, Jira, Notion
```

### XP + AI-Assisted Development

```markdown
## AI as Pair Partner
- Use AI for code suggestions (Copilot, Claude)
- AI for test generation
- AI for refactoring suggestions
- Human reviews AI output

## Cautions
- AI doesn't replace human pairing
- AI may suggest complex solutions (violates simplicity)
- Always test AI-generated code
```

### XP for Solo Developers

```markdown
## Solo XP Practices
✅ TDD - Essential
✅ Simple Design - Essential
✅ Small Releases - Essential
✅ Continuous Integration - Use CI/CD
✅ Refactoring - Essential
⚠️ Pair Programming - Use AI/rubber duck
⚠️ On-site Customer - Async feedback
⚠️ Collective Ownership - N/A
```

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Waterfall in disguise | Big upfront design | Embrace change, iterate |
| Skipping tests | "We'll add later" | TDD is non-negotiable |
| Hero culture | One person saves the day | Sustainable pace, collective ownership |
| No customer access | Building wrong thing | Get real customer or proxy |
| Overtime as normal | Team burnout | Reduce scope, not quality |

## XP vs Other Methodologies

| Aspect | XP | Scrum | Kanban |
|--------|----|----|--------|
| Focus | Engineering practices | Process framework | Flow optimization |
| Iterations | Fixed (1-2 weeks) | Fixed (sprints) | Continuous |
| Roles | No special roles | SM, PO, Team | No required roles |
| Estimation | Story points | Story points | Optional |
| Technical | Prescriptive (TDD, pair) | Non-prescriptive | Non-prescriptive |

## Implementation Checklist

```markdown
## Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Define coding standards

- [ ] Planning game for first iteration
- [ ] First small release
- [ ] Retrospective

## Month 2+: Refinement
- [ ] Measure velocity
- [ ] Refine estimation
- [ ] Improve test coverage
- [ ] Optimize sustainable pace
```
