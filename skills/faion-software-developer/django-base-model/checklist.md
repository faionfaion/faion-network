# Checklist

## Implementation

- [ ] **UUID for external references** - Never expose auto-increment IDs in APIs
- [ ] **Automatic timestamps** - Created and updated times for all records
- [ ] **Consistent interface** - All models have the same base fields
- [ ] **Abstract base** - No database table for the base model itself
- [ ] **Immutable identifiers** - UUID cannot be changed after creation
