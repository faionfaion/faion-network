# Backlog Grooming & Roadmapping Checklist

## Phase 1: Backlog Organization

- [ ] Create backlog structure (ideas/, validated/, specified/, designed/, ready/)
- [ ] Define triage criteria (what makes an idea "valid"?)
- [ ] Set up backlog tracking system (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues)
- [ ] Create backlog item template with RICE scoring fields

## Phase 2: Weekly Grooming Session (30-60 min)

### Part 1: New Ideas Review (10 min)
- [ ] Review new feature requests/ideas
- [ ] Assess alignment with product vision
- [ ] Quick feasibility check
- [ ] Move to "validated" or discard

### Part 2: Backlog Prioritization (20 min)
- [ ] Review top 20 backlog items
- [ ] Recalculate RICE scores with latest data
- [ ] Reorder by priority
- [ ] Identify shifts in prioritization

### Part 3: Item Refinement (20 min)
- [ ] Add detail to next sprint items
- [ ] Write/refine user stories
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria
- [ ] Identify dependencies
- [ ] Break into tasks if needed

### Part 4: Cleanup (10 min)
- [ ] Archive old, irrelevant items
- [ ] Remove duplicates
- [ ] Update effort estimates
- [ ] Flag blockers or risks

## Phase 3: RICE Scoring Calculation

For each candidate item:
- [ ] Estimate Reach (1-10: how many users?)
- [ ] Estimate Impact (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3: how much per user?)
- [ ] Estimate Confidence (50%, 80%, 100%: confidence level)
- [ ] Estimate Effort (person-months: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6+)
- [ ] Calculate RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
- [ ] Compare scores for ranking

## Phase 4: MoSCoW Categorization

For release planning:
- [ ] Identify Must-Haves (~60% of scope) - critical
- [ ] Identify Should-Haves (~20% of scope) - important
- [ ] Identify Could-Haves (~20% of scope) - nice to have
- [ ] Identify Won't-Haves - explicitly document what's NOT in scope
- [ ] Get stakeholder approval

## Phase 5: Roadmap Creation

- [ ] Define time horizon (3-12 months)
- [ ] Choose roadmap format (time-based, theme-based, or hybrid)
- [ ] Identify key milestones/quarters
- [ ] Assign features to quarters with confidence levels
- [ ] Document vision statement (1 sentence)
- [ ] Create "Now/Next/Later" sections

## Phase 6: Roadmap Communication

- [ ] Share draft with product team
- [ ] Get feedback from engineering leads
- [ ] Review with stakeholders
- [ ] Address concerns and adjust
- [ ] Publish roadmap (public or internal)

## Phase 7: Dependencies & Risks

- [ ] Map feature dependencies
- [ ] Identify technical blockers
- [ ] List external dependencies
- [ ] Create risk mitigation plan
- [ ] Document "Not Planned" items with rationale

## Phase 8: Ongoing Maintenance

- [ ] Schedule weekly grooming sessions (30-60 min)
- [ ] Update backlog weekly with new ideas
- [ ] Recalculate RICE scores monthly
- [ ] Update roadmap quarterly (new Q, adjust remaining Qs)
- [ ] Archive completed items
- [ ] Track velocity to improve estimates
