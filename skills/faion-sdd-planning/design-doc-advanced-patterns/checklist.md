# Design Document Advanced Patterns Checklist

## Phase 1: Study Advanced Patterns

- [ ] Read design-doc-advanced-patterns README
- [ ] Review component design patterns
- [ ] Understand security considerations in design
- [ ] Study performance optimization patterns
- [ ] Learn testing strategy patterns
- [ ] Review migration strategies

## Phase 2: Prepare Design Foundations

- [ ] Have specification ready (spec.md)
- [ ] Have constitution reference accessible
- [ ] Identify existing patterns in codebase
- [ ] Prepare reference to similar completed features
- [ ] Create design document template file

## Phase 3: Component Design (if frontend)

- [ ] Design component hierarchy structure
- [ ] Define component props interfaces
- [ ] Plan state management approach
- [ ] Document component behavior
- [ ] List component dependencies

## Phase 4: Advanced Architecture

- [ ] Design advanced patterns needed
- [ ] Document component specifications
- [ ] Plan dependency management
- [ ] Define external service integrations
- [ ] Document security measures for all components

## Phase 5: Performance & Security

- [ ] Include security considerations table
- [ ] Add performance optimization strategies
- [ ] Define performance targets (latency, throughput)
- [ ] Document caching strategies
- [ ] Plan rate limiting and protection

## Phase 6: Testing Strategy

- [ ] Design test pyramid (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Define test coverage targets
- [ ] Plan critical path testing
- [ ] Document mocking strategy
- [ ] Design test data fixtures

## Phase 7: Migration & Rollback

- [ ] Plan data migration if needed
- [ ] Document backwards compatibility
- [ ] Create rollout plan (stages, monitoring)
- [ ] Define rollback procedure
- [ ] Plan feature flag strategy if applicable

## Phase 8: Advanced Pattern Documentation

- [ ] Document all advanced decisions with alternatives
- [ ] Verify consequences are clear
- [ ] Link to related design patterns
- [ ] Include rationale for each decision
- [ ] Update related designs/patterns
