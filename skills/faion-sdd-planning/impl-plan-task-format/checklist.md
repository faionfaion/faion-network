# Implementation Plan Task Format Checklist

## Phase 1: Understand Task Format

- [ ] Read impl-plan-task-format README
- [ ] Learn TASK-XXX naming convention
- [ ] Understand task structure
- [ ] Review required fields
- [ ] Study example task format

## Phase 2: Create Task Template

- [ ] Create task ID (TASK-NNN)
- [ ] Define task title (imperative form)
- [ ] Add description of what to build
- [ ] List acceptance criteria (3-5 specific items)
- [ ] Estimate token complexity

## Phase 3: Define Task Components

- [ ] Specify files to create/modify
- [ ] List dependencies (must complete first)
- [ ] Identify blocking tasks
- [ ] Note parallel opportunities
- [ ] Estimate effort/complexity

## Phase 4: Write Clear Descriptions

- [ ] Start with action verb
- [ ] Be specific and measurable
- [ ] Reference design document sections
- [ ] Note any tricky parts
- [ ] Add helpful context

## Phase 5: Define Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Make criteria testable
- [ ] Be specific (avoid "works well")
- [ ] Include all required functionality
- [ ] Add quality requirements
- [ ] Include test coverage requirements

## Phase 6: Estimate Complexity

- [ ] Consider lines of code
- [ ] Account for testing effort
- [ ] Factor in integration testing
- [ ] Add complexity rating (Low/Medium/High)
- [ ] Estimate tokens needed

## Phase 7: Manage Dependencies

- [ ] Identify tasks that must complete first
- [ ] Mark blocking relationships
- [ ] Note parallel opportunities
- [ ] Plan integration points
- [ ] Document hand-offs

## Phase 8: Organize Task List

- [ ] Order by dependency
- [ ] Group related tasks
- [ ] Identify critical path
- [ ] Balance workload
- [ ] Ensure feasibility
