# Specification Advanced Guidelines Checklist

## Phase 1: Review Advanced Guidelines

- [ ] Read spec-advanced-guidelines README
- [ ] Understand edge case documentation
- [ ] Learn constraint documentation
- [ ] Review performance requirements
- [ ] Study acceptance criteria best practices

## Phase 2: Enhance Requirements

- [ ] Add edge cases for each FR
- [ ] Document boundary conditions
- [ ] List failure scenarios
- [ ] Define error handling requirements
- [ ] Specify recovery procedures

## Phase 3: Document Constraints

- [ ] Add technical constraints
- [ ] Document business constraints
- [ ] List regulatory/compliance requirements
- [ ] Specify performance constraints
- [ ] Define scaling requirements

## Phase 4: Define Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Make each criterion testable
- [ ] Use Given-When-Then format (optional)
- [ ] Be specific with numbers/values
- [ ] Include both happy and unhappy paths
- [ ] Add performance criteria

## Phase 5: Handle Complex Requirements

- [ ] Break complex FR into sub-requirements
- [ ] Use sequencing diagrams if needed
- [ ] Document state machines if applicable
- [ ] Add timeline/sequencing requirements
- [ ] Specify priorities between conflicting requirements

## Phase 6: Define Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Document performance targets
- [ ] Define security requirements
- [ ] Specify scalability needs
- [ ] Document compliance requirements
- [ ] Add reliability/uptime targets

## Phase 7: Quality Review

- [ ] Verify all requirements are clear
- [ ] Check for ambiguity
- [ ] Ensure testability
- [ ] Review for completeness
- [ ] Validate acceptance criteria
