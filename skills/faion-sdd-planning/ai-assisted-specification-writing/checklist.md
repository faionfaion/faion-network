# AI-Assisted Specification Writing Checklist

## Phase 1: Intent Capture

- [ ] Describe the problem or feature clearly
- [ ] Identify product context (domain, target users)
- [ ] List business constraints
- [ ] Document technical constraints
- [ ] Define success criteria
- [ ] Identify stakeholders

## Phase 2: AI-Assisted Requirement Generation

- [ ] Prepare context prompt for AI (product, users, constraints)
- [ ] Request functional requirements with FR-X format
- [ ] Review AI-generated requirements for completeness
- [ ] Request edge case enumeration
- [ ] Validate edge cases against domain knowledge
- [ ] Request acceptance criteria for each requirement
- [ ] Approve testable acceptance criteria

## Phase 3: Specification Structure

- [ ] Use standard spec.md template
- [ ] Document all functional requirements with IDs
- [ ] Write user stories (As [user], I want [action], so that [benefit])
- [ ] List dependencies explicitly
- [ ] Mark technical constraints as testable/measurable
- [ ] Clearly define scope (what's NOT included)
- [ ] Note potential risks

## Phase 4: Quality Gates

- [ ] All requirements have acceptance criteria
- [ ] Edge cases documented
- [ ] Dependencies listed
- [ ] Constraints are measurable
- [ ] Scope boundaries clear
- [ ] No conflicting requirements
- [ ] Request AI review of spec

## Phase 5: Human Review & Approval

- [ ] Review AI-generated content against domain knowledge
- [ ] Verify completeness with product team
- [ ] Get stakeholder sign-off
- [ ] Address feedback
- [ ] Document approved version
- [ ] Archive specification
