# Implementation Plan - 100k Rule Checklist

## Phase 1: Understand 100k Rule

- [ ] Read impl-plan-100k-rule README
- [ ] Understand max 100k tokens per task
- [ ] Learn task breakdown principles
- [ ] Review complexity estimation
- [ ] Understand when to split tasks

## Phase 2: Prepare for Implementation Plan

- [ ] Have approved design document ready
- [ ] Understand all architectural decisions
- [ ] Review file structure from design
- [ ] Identify all dependencies
- [ ] List all components/modules

## Phase 3: Estimate Task Complexity

- [ ] Review each AD from design
- [ ] Estimate token complexity for each
- [ ] Consider file count for each feature
- [ ] Account for test writing
- [ ] Plan integration test complexity
- [ ] Estimate E2E test tokens

## Phase 4: Break into Task Units

- [ ] Identify logical task boundaries
- [ ] Ensure each task < 100k tokens
- [ ] Create task dependencies
- [ ] Plan sequential ordering
- [ ] Group related work together

## Phase 5: Define Task Granularity

- [ ] Plan backend service tasks
- [ ] Plan API endpoint tasks
- [ ] Plan database migration tasks
- [ ] Plan frontend component tasks
- [ ] Plan test writing tasks

## Phase 6: Account for Complexity

- [ ] Add setup/scaffolding tasks first
- [ ] Include test writing in estimates
- [ ] Account for integration testing
- [ ] Include documentation tasks
- [ ] Plan review/refinement time

## Phase 7: Validate Token Estimates

- [ ] Ensure each task within 100k
- [ ] Add buffer for unknown unknowns
- [ ] Review critical path
- [ ] Check interdependencies
- [ ] Verify realistic ordering

## Phase 8: Document Task List

- [ ] Create numbered task list
- [ ] Add complexity rating (Low/Medium/High)
- [ ] Include token estimates
- [ ] Document dependencies
- [ ] Note parallel vs sequential work
