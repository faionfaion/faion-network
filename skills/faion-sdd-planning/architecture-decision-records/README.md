# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

### Problem

Architecture decisions are lost over time:
- New team members don't understand "why" of existing design
- Same discussions repeated without historical context
- Production incidents lack design context
- Decisions seem "puzzling" without knowing when/why they were made

### Framework

#### What is an ADR?

A document capturing an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences.

#### ADR Structure (Nygard Format)

```
+-------------------------------------+
| TITLE: Short decision description   |
+-------------------------------------+
| STATUS: Proposed|Accepted|Deprecated|
+-------------------------------------+
| CONTEXT: What is the situation?     |
+-------------------------------------+
| DECISION: What did we decide?       |
+-------------------------------------+
| CONSEQUENCES: What results from it? |
+-------------------------------------+
```

#### ADR Lifecycle

```
PROPOSED -> ACCEPTED -> [DEPRECATED | SUPERSEDED]
    |          |              |
  Review    Active        Link to new ADR
  period    decision
```

#### Status Types

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Proposed** | Under discussion, gathering feedback |
| **Accepted** | Approved, active decision |
| **Deprecated** | No longer relevant, kept for history |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by newer ADR (link required) |

### Templates

#### ADR Template (docs/adr/NNN-title.md)

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Decision Title]

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders:** [List of people involved]

## Context

[What is the issue? What forces are at play?
Include technical, business, and team constraints.]

## Decision

[What is the change being proposed/made?
State in full sentences with active voice: "We will..."]

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: [Name]
- **Pros:** [benefits]
- **Cons:** [drawbacks]
- **Why rejected:** [reason]

### Alternative 2: [Name]
...

## Consequences

### Positive
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

### Negative
- [Tradeoff 1]
- [Risk to mitigate]

### Neutral
- [Implication neither good nor bad]


## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Planning task breakdown | haiku | Task decomposition from checklist |
| Estimating task complexity | sonnet | Comparative complexity assessment |
| Creating strategic roadmaps | opus | Long-term planning, dependency chains |
## Related Decisions

- ADR-NNN: [Related decision]
- ADR-NNN: [Supersedes this if applicable]

## Notes

[Any additional context, meeting notes, or future considerations]
```

### Best Practices

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Co-locate with code** | Store in `docs/adr/` in same repo |
| **Sequential numbering** | Use NNN format (001, 002...) |
| **Immutable by default** | Prefer new ADR over editing existing |
| **Timestamp everything** | Include date and system version |
| **Keep pithy** | Focus on decision, not design guide |
| **Single decision focus** | One ADR = one decision |
| **Cross-functional review** | Involve affected teams (under 10 people) |
| **Silent reading** | Amazon-style: 10 min read, then discuss |

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| ADR as design guide | Keep focused on decision, not implementation details |
| Not updating status | Mark superseded ADRs, link to replacement |
| Missing alternatives | Always document what you considered and rejected |
| No timestamps | Include date for historical context |
| Hidden in wiki | Store in version control with code |
