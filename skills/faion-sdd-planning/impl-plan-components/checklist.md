# Implementation Plan Components Checklist

## Phase 1: Understand Components

- [ ] Read impl-plan-components README
- [ ] Review task breakdown principles
- [ ] Understand component types
- [ ] Learn dependency management
- [ ] Review completion criteria

## Phase 2: Identify Implementation Components

- [ ] List backend service components
- [ ] List API endpoint components
- [ ] List database components
- [ ] List frontend components (if applicable)
- [ ] List test components

## Phase 3: Break Components into Tasks

- [ ] Create setup/scaffolding task
- [ ] Create individual component creation tasks
- [ ] Create service layer tasks
- [ ] Create API endpoint tasks
- [ ] Create integration tasks

## Phase 4: Define Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] For each task, list specific acceptance criteria
- [ ] Include code quality criteria
- [ ] Add test coverage requirements
- [ ] Define performance requirements
- [ ] Include security validation

## Phase 5: Plan Dependencies

- [ ] Identify which tasks must run first
- [ ] Mark setup/scaffolding as blocking
- [ ] Note service dependencies
- [ ] Track database migration order
- [ ] Plan integration testing order

## Phase 6: Estimate Effort

- [ ] Estimate tokens for each task
- [ ] Add complexity ratings
- [ ] Identify critical path
- [ ] Plan for integration time
- [ ] Include contingency

## Phase 7: Organize Component Task List

- [ ] Order tasks by dependency
- [ ] Group related components
- [ ] Plan parallel workstreams
- [ ] Identify blocking tasks
- [ ] Document task relationships

## Phase 8: Validate Component Plan

- [ ] Check all FR-X covered by tasks
- [ ] Verify all components defined
- [ ] Confirm dependencies correct
- [ ] Review token estimates realistic
- [ ] Ensure testing included
