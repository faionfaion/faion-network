# BA Strategy Methods: Solution Options & Assessment

Solution options analysis, limitation assessment, and BA technique reference.

---

## 1. Solution Options Analysis

### Problem
How to evaluate and recommend the best solution option?

### Framework

1. **Options Identification**
   - Generate alternatives
   - Include "do nothing" baseline
   - Consider combinations

2. **Evaluation Criteria**
   - Strategic fit
   - Technical feasibility
   - Financial viability
   - Organizational impact
   - Risk profile

3. **Scoring Method**
   - Weighted criteria
   - Scoring scale (1-5)
   - Sensitivity analysis

4. **Recommendation**
   - Best option selection
   - Justification
   - Conditions and caveats

## Solution Options Analysis

### Options
| # | Option | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| A | {name} | {description} |
| B | {name} | {description} |
| C | {name} | {description} |

### Evaluation Criteria
| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Strategic fit | 25% |
| Technical feasibility | 20% |
| Cost | 20% |
| Time to value | 20% |
| Risk | 15% |

### Scoring Matrix
| Criterion | Weight | Opt A | Opt B | Opt C |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Strategic fit | 25% | 4 | 3 | 5 |
| Technical | 20% | 5 | 4 | 3 |
| Cost | 20% | 3 | 4 | 2 |
| Time | 20% | 3 | 5 | 2 |
| Risk | 15% | 4 | 4 | 3 |
| **Weighted Score** | | **3.75** | **3.95** | **3.10** |

### Recommendation
**Option B** is recommended because {rationale}

### Conditions
- Requires {condition}
- Assumes {assumption}

## 2. Solution Limitation Assessment

### Problem
How to identify and address solution limitations?

### Framework

1. **Defect Identification**
   - Functional gaps
   - Performance issues
   - Usability problems

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Technical causes
   - Process causes
   - Organizational causes

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Business impact
   - User impact
   - Operational impact

4. **Remediation Options**
   - Quick fixes
   - Workarounds
   - Permanent solutions
   - Accept limitations

### Template

```markdown
## Solution Limitation Assessment

### Identified Limitations
| ID | Limitation | Category | Severity |
|----|------------|----------|----------|
| L-001 | {description} | Functional | High |
| L-002 | {description} | Performance | Medium |

### Root Cause Analysis
| Limitation | Root Cause | Evidence |
|------------|------------|----------|
| L-001 | {cause} | {evidence} |

### Impact Assessment
| Limitation | Business Impact | User Impact | Frequency |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| L-001 | {impact} | {impact} | Daily |

### Remediation Recommendations
| Limitation | Option | Effort | Recommendation |
|------------|--------|--------|----------------|
| L-001 | A: Fix in v2 | 3 sprints | Accept for now |
| L-001 | B: Workaround | 2 days | Implement |
