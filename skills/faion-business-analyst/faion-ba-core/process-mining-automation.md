## Process Mining and Intelligent Automation Analysis

### Problem

Process documentation relies on subjective stakeholder input. Actual process execution differs from documented processes. Automation opportunities are identified based on assumptions rather than data. RPA initiatives fail due to poor process understanding.

### Solution

Use process mining to discover actual process flows from system data. Apply data-driven approach to automation candidate selection.

### Process Mining for BAs

**Definition:** Process mining is a data-driven methodology that reconstructs and analyzes how business processes actually run by extracting event logs from IT systems.

### BA Skills for Process Mining

| Skill Category | Required Competencies |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Technical | ProM, Disco, Celonis, SQL, data visualization |
| Process | BPMN 2.0, process modeling, workflow analysis |
| Analytical | Statistics, pattern recognition, variance analysis |
| Domain | Industry knowledge, regulatory understanding |

### Process Mining Workflow

```
Event Log Extraction -> Process Discovery -> Conformance Checking -> Enhancement
        |                    |                    |                    |
   IT Systems           Actual Model       Compare to Design      Optimize
```
