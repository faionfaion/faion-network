## Problem

Business analysis seems like a collection of random activities. There is no structure to how BA work is organized. Teams do not know which activities are appropriate for their situation. BA deliverables are inconsistent across projects.

BA Framework provides a framework that organizes BA work into coherent knowledge areas.

## Framework

### What is BA Framework?

The Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BA Framework) is a globally recognized standard published by BA industry that describes the practices and knowledge needed for effective business analysis.

### The 6 Knowledge Areas
