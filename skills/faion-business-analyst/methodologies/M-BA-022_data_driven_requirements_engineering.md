## M-BA-022: Data-Driven Requirements Engineering

### Problem

Requirements are based on stakeholder opinions rather than evidence. Prioritization is political rather than value-based. Success metrics are defined after implementation. Analytics capabilities are underutilized in requirements definition.

### Solution

Apply data analytics to requirements engineering. Use evidence-based approaches to prioritization and validation.

### Data-Driven BA Competencies

| Competency | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| Statistical Analysis | Validate assumptions with data |
| Data Visualization | Communicate insights to stakeholders |
| SQL/BI Tools | Extract and analyze business data |
| A/B Testing | Validate solution options |
| Predictive Analytics | Forecast feature impact |

### Evidence-Based Requirements Process

```
Business Question -> Data Collection -> Analysis -> Insight -> Requirement
       |                  |              |          |           |
   What problem?     What data?     What pattern?  So what?   What to build?
```

### Key Analytics Trends (2025-2026)

- 91.9% of organizations gain measurable value from data/analytics
- 65% of organizations have adopted or are investigating AI for analytics
- Data-driven companies are 23x more likely to acquire customers
- 95% of enterprise AI projects fail without solid data strategy

### Analytics-Informed Prioritization

| Metric Type | Examples | Use in Prioritization |
|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| Usage Data | Page views, feature adoption | Prioritize improvements to high-use features |
| Performance Data | Error rates, load times | Address bottlenecks affecting user experience |
| Business Metrics | Conversion, revenue | Focus on revenue-impacting features |
| Customer Feedback | NPS, support tickets | Address pain points with highest volume |

### Self-Service Analytics for BAs

Modern tools enable BAs to perform analytics without data science expertise:

| Tool Category | Examples | BA Use Case |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| BI Dashboards | Tableau, Power BI | KPI monitoring, trend analysis |
| SQL Interfaces | Mode, Looker | Custom data queries |
| No-Code Analytics | Dataiku, Alteryx | Automated analysis workflows |
| NLP Query | ThoughtSpot | Natural language data exploration |

### AI/ML ROI Measurement Framework

**Impact Areas (2026 Standard):**

| Area | Metrics |
|------|---------|
| Operational Efficiency | Cycle time, throughput, error rate, rework % |
| Experience & Growth | CSAT/NPS, conversion rate, retention |
| Financial | Cost-to-serve, gross margin, working capital |
| Risk & Compliance | Policy violations avoided, audit hours saved |
