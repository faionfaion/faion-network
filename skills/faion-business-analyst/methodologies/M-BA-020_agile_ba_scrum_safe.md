## M-BA-020: Agile Business Analysis in Scrum and SAFe

### Problem

Business analysts struggle to find their role in agile frameworks. SAFe does not explicitly define a BA role. Traditional BA activities do not map cleanly to agile ceremonies. Organizations need guidance on integrating BA competencies into agile delivery.

### Solution

Map BA competencies to agile roles and ceremonies. Understand where BA skills add value in Scrum and SAFe.
