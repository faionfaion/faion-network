## Problem

Systems are built in isolation. Integration with other systems is an afterthought. Data flows between systems are undocumented. When systems need to communicate, it becomes a scramble. Interface requirements are discovered during development.

Without interface analysis:
- Integration failures
- Data inconsistencies
- Undefined handoffs
- Late surprises

---

## Framework

### What is Interface Analysis?

Interface analysis identifies and documents the boundaries and connections between:
- The solution and external systems
- The solution and users
- Different components of the solution
- The solution and external parties

### Interface Types

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **User interface** | Human interaction points | Screens, reports, forms |
| **System interface** | System-to-system connections | APIs, file transfers, databases |
| **Hardware interface** | Physical device connections | Scanners, printers, sensors |
| **Communication interface** | Data exchange protocols | HTTP, SFTP, message queues |

### Step 1: Identify Interfaces

List all connection points:

**Questions:**
- What systems will this solution connect to?
- What data comes in and goes out?
- Who are the users?
- What devices are involved?
- What external parties interact?

### Step 2: Document Interface Details

For each interface, capture:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Identifier for the interface |
| **Type** | User/System/Hardware/Communication |
| **Direction** | Inbound/Outbound/Bidirectional |
| **Source/Target** | What systems/users are connected |
| **Data** | What information is exchanged |
| **Format** | Data structure and encoding |
| **Protocol** | How exchange happens |
| **Frequency** | When exchange occurs |
| **Volume** | How much data |
| **Security** | Authentication, encryption |
| **Error handling** | What happens on failure |

### Step 3: Define Data Elements

For each interface, specify data:

| Element | Type | Required | Validation | Description |
|---------|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| [Field] | [Type] | Y/N | [Rules] | [Meaning] |

### Step 4: Specify Behaviors

Define how interface operates:
- Normal flow
- Error scenarios
- Retry logic
- Timeout handling

### Step 5: Validate with Stakeholders

Review interfaces with:
- Technical teams of connected systems
- Users for UI interfaces
- Operations for monitoring
- Security for access control

## Common Mistakes

1. **Assuming compatibility** - Not specifying data formats
2. **Ignoring errors** - Only happy path documented
3. **No versioning** - Interface changes break integrations
4. **Missing security** - Authentication not specified
5. **Volume underestimated** - System cannot handle load

---

## Interface Questions Checklist

**For each interface:**
- [ ] Who/what is on each end?
- [ ] What data is exchanged?
- [ ] What is the format?
- [ ] How is it triggered?
- [ ] How often?
- [ ] How much data?
- [ ] What can go wrong?
- [ ] How are errors handled?
- [ ] What security is needed?
- [ ] Who is responsible?

## Next Steps

After interface analysis:
1. Coordinate with external system owners
2. Define integration testing approach
3. Plan implementation sequence
4. Document SLAs
5. Connect to BA Knowledge Areas Summary methodology
