# Core VUI Design Principles

## Problem

Voice interfaces fail when designed like visual interfaces.

## Principle 1: Simplicity and Clarity

**DO:**
"Your order is confirmed for delivery tomorrow."

**DON'T:**
"Your order has been successfully processed and scheduled for delivery on January 20th at a time between 9 AM and 5 PM in your local timezone."

## Principle 2: Natural Conversation

**DO:**
```
User: "What's the weather?"
VUI: "It's 72 degrees and sunny. Should I tell you about tomorrow?"
```

**DON'T:**
```
User: "What's the weather?"
VUI: "The current temperature is 72 degrees Fahrenheit
with sunny conditions. Humidity is 45 percent."
```

## Principle 3: Context Awareness

- Remember previous conversation turns
- Understand follow-up questions
- Maintain context across sessions
- Adapt to user preferences
