# Spatial Design Tools

## Problem

Traditional design tools don't support spatial design.

## Tools Landscape

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| Figma (3D plugins) | 2D to 3D preview |
| ShapesXR | VR prototyping |
| Gravity Sketch | VR-native design |
| Unity | 3D development |
| Unreal Engine | High-fidelity XR |
| Reality Composer | Apple spatial design |
| Spark AR | Meta AR effects |

## Design-to-Development

**Concept:**
- 2D wireframes with spatial annotations
- Storyboard key interactions

**Prototype:**
- Low-fi in ShapesXR or similar
- Test in actual headset

**Iteration:**
- Unity/Unreal high-fi prototype
- User testing in target environment

**Production:**
- Full development
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility review

## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|
| Design system documentation | haiku | Pattern application: organizing and documenting existing design tokens |
