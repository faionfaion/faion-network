# AI-Enhanced Design Systems

## Problem

Scaling design systems requires significant manual effort.

## AI Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Component generation | AI generates variations |
| Documentation | Auto-generate component docs |
| Pattern recognition | Identify inconsistencies |
| Token suggestions | Recommend token values |
| Usage analytics | Track adoption patterns |

## AI Amplification Principle

AI will not magically correct deficiencies within a design system. It will amplify and extend the foundational structures provided.

## Prerequisites for Success

**Solid foundation:**
- Well-defined tokens
- Systematic component structure
- Clear naming conventions
- Documented relationships

**Then AI can:**
- Scale out variations
- Generate documentation
- Suggest improvements
- Identify patterns
