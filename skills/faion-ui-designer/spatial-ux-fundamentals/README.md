# Spatial UX Fundamentals

## Problem

2D UI patterns don't translate to 3D spatial interfaces.

## Core Considerations

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Scale | UI elements at appropriate world-scale |
| Reach | Content within comfortable arm reach |
| Sight-lines | No content in peripheral blind spots |
| Occlusion | Handle content blocking |
| Orientation | Maintain spatial consistency |
| Environment | Adapt to physical surroundings |

## Spatial Hierarchy

**Near field (0-1m):**
- Primary interactions
- Menus, controls
- Immediate feedback

**Mid field (1-3m):**
- Content consumption
- Work surfaces
- Collaboration space

**Far field (3m+):**
- Environmental context
- Navigation aids
- Background content

## Agent Selection

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|
| Spatial UI design strategy | opus | Novel patterns: designing for XR/3D environments with new interaction models |
